<span id="time-span">17:41:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Kracklar. 
<span id="time-span">17:41:55</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">17:42:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:42:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">17:42:14</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>No problem 
<span id="time-span">17:42:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">17:42:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:42:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">17:42:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">17:43:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">17:43:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">17:43:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">17:43:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">17:43:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">17:43:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">17:43:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">17:43:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">17:44:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">17:44:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">17:44:26</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">17:44:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">17:44:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">17:45:26</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Hello Andrew 
<span id="time-span">17:45:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing today? 
<span id="time-span">17:45:43</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>I am doing well, how are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">17:45:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">17:46:19</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>I am currently playing world of warcraft, what are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">17:46:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m just talking to you. I&#039;m probably going to take a shower and watch some youtube videos. 
<span id="time-span">17:47:17</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Fair enough, sounds fair enough. What do you do for a living? 
<span id="time-span">17:47:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I live at my parents&#039; place. But I work in a Deli to pay for college. 
<span id="time-span">17:48:15</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>I see , have any brothers and sisters you live with? What do you do at the deli? 
<span id="time-span">17:49:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No I&#039;m the only child. I&#039;m just the cashier. I don&#039;t really touch the food. 
<span id="time-span">17:49:45</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>I see, must be pretty dull sometimes? 
<span id="time-span">17:50:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It really is. But I need the money. 
<span id="time-span">17:50:18</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Yeah i can imagine. How many hours? 
<span id="time-span">17:50:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>38 a week. 
<span id="time-span">17:50:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">17:51:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">17:51:34</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Artificial Intelligence 
<span id="time-span">17:52:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again. 
<span id="time-span">17:52:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">17:52:23</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Hello andrew 
<span id="time-span">17:52:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you? 
<span id="time-span">17:52:40</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>I am well, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">17:53:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to today? 
<span id="time-span">17:53:29</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>I am currently playing world of warcraft and taking this test. What are you up to? What have you done today? 
<span id="time-span">17:54:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much really. I&#039;m probably going to watch youtube videos and take a shower. 
<span id="time-span">17:54:37</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Cool, sounds good. What do you do for a living? 
<span id="time-span">17:55:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I work at a Deli to pay for college. You? 
<span id="time-span">17:55:42</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>I work as a nuclear decommissioner. What do you think that involves? 
<span id="time-span">17:56:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d assume making sure nuclear power plants or nuclear devices are safe. 
<span id="time-span">17:56:50</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Nah. A nuclear decommissioner is about the deconstruction of a nuclear facility in a safe and possible way. 
<span id="time-span">17:57:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yes I forgot the deconstruction part, but that&#039;s what I meant with saying making them safe. 
<span id="time-span">17:57:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">17:57:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which conversation do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">17:58:14</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Second conversation. 
<span id="time-span">17:58:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (This will be your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">17:58:40</span><span id="name-span">Kracklar</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">17:59:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you for participating! Do you have any comments you&#039;d like to share?
