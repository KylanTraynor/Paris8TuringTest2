<span id="time-span">00:17:27</span><span id="name-span">Renly</span>Howdy. 
<span id="time-span">00:18:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Renly. 
<span id="time-span">00:19:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:19:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">00:19:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">00:19:58</span><span id="name-span">Renly</span>Alright sounds good. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">00:21:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">00:21:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">00:21:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">00:21:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">00:21:41</span><span id="name-span">Renly</span>I fully understand your guidelines. 
<span id="time-span">00:21:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">00:22:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello!

<span id="time-span">00:26:49</span><span id="name-span">Renly</span>I&#039;ll give you a guess, three options. I&#039;m either playing: A.) A shooter, B.) A puzzle game, C.) A platformer. What do you think I&#039;m playing? 
<span id="time-span">00:27:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I have no idea? I&#039;d say a shooter.
