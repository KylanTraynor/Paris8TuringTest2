<span id="time-span">01:08:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello BB Brand. 
<span id="time-span">01:08:36</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Hey, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">01:08:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I&#039;m doing alright! Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:09:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">01:09:15</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Sure. 
<span id="time-span">01:09:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">01:09:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:09:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">01:11:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">01:11:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">01:11:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">01:11:30</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">01:11:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:12:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:12:24</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Hello, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">01:12:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright thank you. You? 
<span id="time-span">01:13:08</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>I&#039;m doing very well.  So, what&#039;s been happening with you lately?  Like, life stuff?  For example, I just got a job. 
<span id="time-span">01:13:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Congrats! Not much for me. I&#039;m working at a Deli until college starts. 
<span id="time-span">01:14:12</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Oh yeah?  Do you like it? 
<span id="time-span">01:14:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not really, but I need the money. What kind of job did you find? 
<span id="time-span">01:15:37</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>It&#039;s a job related to dentistry marketing.  We call dental offices all across the country and attempt to sell them content to help boost their sales and customer base. 
<span id="time-span">01:16:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You must sound very charismatic I imagine then. 
<span id="time-span">01:16:42</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>I like to think that I sound that way, though I&#039;ve never done cold calling before. 
<span id="time-span">01:17:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds much more interesting than my job. 
<span id="time-span">01:17:08</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>I used to be an Uber driver, but I wanted something with an actual schedule and a boss to report to. 
<span id="time-span">01:17:24</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>I&#039;ve worked in food service before, though.  At McDonald&#039;s. 
<span id="time-span">01:17:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">01:17:46</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>All right! 
<span id="time-span">01:17:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">01:18:03</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>The chatbot. 
<span id="time-span">01:18:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We will start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again. 
<span id="time-span">01:18:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:18:57</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Hey, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">01:19:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright thanks! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">01:19:40</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>I&#039;m doing well.  So what&#039;s been happening with you in life lately?  For example, I start my last semester of college in September. 
<span id="time-span">01:19:55</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>So in that vein, what&#039;s happening with you? 
<span id="time-span">01:20:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much really. Just working at a Deli until college starts. 
<span id="time-span">01:20:38</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Do you like it? 
<span id="time-span">01:20:52</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>I remember working in food service.  I didn&#039;t like it very much. 
<span id="time-span">01:21:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s alright I guess. I need the money though. 
<span id="time-span">01:21:56</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Have you worked in the past? 
<span id="time-span">01:22:03</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Or do you go to school? 
<span id="time-span">01:22:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I just do summer jobs. And then college the rest of the year. 
<span id="time-span">01:23:02</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>I see.  Which year are you in?  Freshman, sophomore, etc.? 
<span id="time-span">01:23:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m a sophomore. 
<span id="time-span">01:24:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">01:24:15</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Aw, nuts!  I was gonna ask what his major was. 
<span id="time-span">01:24:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I&#039;m afraid it&#039;s too late! Which conversation do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">01:24:46</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>The second. 
<span id="time-span">01:25:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (This will be your final answer )
<span id="time-span">01:25:11</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">01:25:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright! Thank you for participating. Do you have any comments? 
<span id="time-span">01:25:58</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Whichever one the chatbot was, it was very convincingly human. 
<span id="time-span">01:26:14</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>That&#039;s all I have to say. 
<span id="time-span">01:26:25</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Will you tell me which one was which? 
<span id="time-span">01:27:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, that&#039;s noted. The chatbot was the second one. In your case it wasn&#039;t quite visible since you didn&#039;t ask questions involving its memory (The bot would have been unable to answer correctly) 
<span id="time-span">01:27:42</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>I see.  Oh well.\ 
<span id="time-span">01:28:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you again! If you&#039;d like to see the results of the study, you can share your email here if you didn&#039;t in the form. 
<span id="time-span">01:28:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">01:28:16</span><span id="name-span">BB Brand</span>Sure.
