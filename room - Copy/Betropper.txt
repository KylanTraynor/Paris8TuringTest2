<span id="time-span">04:12:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Betropper 
<span id="time-span">04:13:06</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:13:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">04:13:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">04:13:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">04:13:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">04:13:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">04:15:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">04:15:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">04:15:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">04:15:29</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Yes! 
<span id="time-span">04:15:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">04:15:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:16:13</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Hey Andrew! 
<span id="time-span">04:16:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">04:16:29</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Pretty well, you? 
<span id="time-span">04:16:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! What are you up to tonight? 
<span id="time-span">04:17:32</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Oh, nothing much. Doing this experiment, relaxing, the usual. 
<span id="time-span">04:18:14</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>You? 
<span id="time-span">04:18:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nice! I&#039;ll probably be watching some youtube videos once we&#039;ll be done here. 
<span id="time-span">04:18:48</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Oh, cool, what kind of youtube videos? 
<span id="time-span">04:19:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Game of Thrones theories. They help passing time while I wait for season 7. 
<span id="time-span">04:20:12</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Makes sense! I&#039;ve heard a bit about that, but not too much. Who&#039;s your favorite character? 
<span id="time-span">04:20:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d have to say Aria. She&#039;s really badass. 
<span id="time-span">04:21:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">04:21:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (This is not your final answer )
<span id="time-span">04:22:19</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>I think it was the human, but not too sure. 
<span id="time-span">04:22:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again. 
<span id="time-span">04:23:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:23:15</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Hey Andrew! What&#039;s up? 
<span id="time-span">04:23:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">04:24:08</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Pretty well, just relaxing for the night. Up to anything yourself? 
<span id="time-span">04:24:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ll probably be watching youtube videos once we&#039;ll be done here. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">04:25:33</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>I&#039;ll probably be heading off to bed here soon myself, it&#039;s getting pretty late.  What time is it over where you are?
<span id="time-span">04:26:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds nice. Do you know Game of Thrones? 
<span id="time-span">04:27:28</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>I&#039;ve heard of it, but I don&#039;t know too much about it. What&#039;s it about? 
<span id="time-span">04:28:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s quite a good show. It can get quite graphic sometimes though. And to answer your question it&#039;s 10:30 pm here. 
<span id="time-span">04:28:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">04:28:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which of the two conversations do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">04:29:03</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>The first one 
<span id="time-span">04:29:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (This will be your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">04:29:28</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Yes! 
<span id="time-span">04:29:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you for participating! Do you have any comments you&#039;d like to share? 
<span id="time-span">04:30:34</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Nope, other than that this is a cool experiment! 
<span id="time-span">04:30:52</span><span id="name-span">Betropper</span>Anything else you need from me? 
<span id="time-span">04:31:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you! If you&#039;d like to see the results when they are ready, you can share your email address here if you didn&#039;t in the form. Otherwise you can now close this window.
