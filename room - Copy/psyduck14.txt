<span id="time-span">04:35:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello psyduck14. 
<span id="time-span">04:35:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:03</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>no problem 
<span id="time-span">04:36:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">04:38:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">04:38:07</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">04:38:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">04:38:21</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">04:38:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:38:43</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>hey andrew 
<span id="time-span">04:38:46</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>how are you 
<span id="time-span">04:38:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">04:39:08</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>Pretty good 
<span id="time-span">04:39:12</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>are you the human? 
<span id="time-span">04:39:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup I am. You? 
<span id="time-span">04:39:39</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>nope 
<span id="time-span">04:39:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What  does it feel like?
<span id="time-span">04:40:15</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>to not be human? it feels like nothing 
<span id="time-span">04:40:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds quite boring. I&#039;d have expected it would be more... shocking, or electrifying. 
<span id="time-span">04:41:03</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>No, it&#039;s just boring. Do you watch the Olympics? 
<span id="time-span">04:41:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I usually do, but this year I completely forgot they even existed. 
<span id="time-span">04:41:46</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>Do you own a TV? 
<span id="time-span">04:41:55</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>You are missing out. 
<span id="time-span">04:42:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Multiple ones. They are just all plugged to computers. TV tends to be quite boring. 
<span id="time-span">04:42:32</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>You don&#039;t watch any TV shows? 
<span id="time-span">04:42:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I watch Game of Thrones. That&#039;s about it right now. 
<span id="time-span">04:43:11</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>Who is your favourite character? 
<span id="time-span">04:43:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d have to say Aria. She&#039;s really badass. 
<span id="time-span">04:43:40</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>I agree, she is badass 
<span id="time-span">04:43:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">04:44:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (this is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">04:44:17</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>AI 
<span id="time-span">04:44:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again.

<span id="time-span">04:48:16</span><span id="name-span">psyduck14</span>Andrew 
<span id="time-span">04:48:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I won&#039;t spoil you then. You should watch season 6 soon though, or other people will.
