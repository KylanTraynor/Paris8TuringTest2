<span id="time-span">22:58:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Lady! 
<span id="time-span">22:58:55</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Hello Mod! 
<span id="time-span">22:59:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:59:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">22:59:23</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Alright 
<span id="time-span">22:59:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">22:59:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:59:52</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Ooh la la! 
<span id="time-span">22:59:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:00:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:00:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:00:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:00:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:00:41</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Sounds fun! 
<span id="time-span">23:00:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:01:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:01:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:01:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">23:01:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:01:43</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>OK 
<span id="time-span">23:01:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:01:52</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Yes sir. 
<span id="time-span">23:01:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:02:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:02:23</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:02:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:02:40</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>I am doing well. And yourself? 
<span id="time-span">23:02:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thank you. What are you up to this evening? 
<span id="time-span">23:03:17</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Just some crochet and Netflix. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:03:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Just talking to you. Probably going to watch some youtube videos and take a shower. 
<span id="time-span">23:04:25</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>What type of videos? Certain genre you enjoy? 
<span id="time-span">23:04:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly Game of Thrones theories while I wait for Season 7. 
<span id="time-span">23:04:55</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>I have never seen it. 
<span id="time-span">23:05:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s quite good. But it can be quite graphic. 
<span id="time-span">23:05:38</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Yeah, I am not into all the graphic stuff. 
<span id="time-span">23:05:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of shows are you into? 
<span id="time-span">23:06:27</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Oh, I watch many. I am currently working my way through the series, &quot;Charmed&quot; on Netflix. Nearly done. 
<span id="time-span">23:06:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve watched it a while ago. Isn&#039;t it very old? 
<span id="time-span">23:07:12</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Yeah, it went off the air about 10 years ago. 
<span id="time-span">23:07:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:07:38</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:07:43</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>That was fast. lol 
<span id="time-span">23:07:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (Human or AI? )
<span id="time-span">23:08:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>(This is not your final answer )
<span id="time-span">23:08:16</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>I can&#039;t be sure until I talk to the second actor, but I am thinking human. 
<span id="time-span">23:08:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. The other Andrew will start the next conversation. Just like before, you&#039;ll have 5 minutes to figure out if it&#039;s an AI or a human. 
<span id="time-span">23:09:06</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>OK 
<span id="time-span">23:09:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:09:17</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Greetings! 
<span id="time-span">23:09:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:09:37</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>I am doing quite alright. You? 
<span id="time-span">23:09:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to this evening? 
<span id="time-span">23:10:29</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Just watching some Netflix and doing some crochet. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:11:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m just talking to you. Probably going to take a shower and watch youtube videos. 
<span id="time-span">23:11:42</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>You shouldn&#039;t watch youtube in the shower. That can be dangerous. 
<span id="time-span">23:12:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ll try to remember that. 
<span id="time-span">23:12:37</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>What type of youtube videos do you watch? 
<span id="time-span">23:13:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly Game of Thrones theories while I wait for Season 7. 
<span id="time-span">23:13:28</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>What is the craziest one you have heard? 
<span id="time-span">23:14:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That Aria and the other girl are the same person. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s true, but it&#039;s kind of weird. 
<span id="time-span">23:14:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:14:41</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:14:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which of the two conversations do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">23:16:37</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>It&#039;s hard to say. On one hand, the second conversation was much colder, but that could have just been the human trying to sound neutral. And would the AI really be aware of crazy GoT fan theories? 
<span id="time-span">23:16:59</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>I am going to say, though, that the first one was human. 
<span id="time-span">23:17:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (This will be your final answer. )
<span id="time-span">23:17:59</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Yes, my answer is the first actor was the human. 
<span id="time-span">23:18:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thanks a lot for participating! If you have any comment, you&#039;re welcome to share them now. If not, you can close the window. 
<span id="time-span">23:18:58</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Are you going to tell me if I was correct? 
<span id="time-span">23:19:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you&#039;d like to see the results of the study when they will be ready, you can also share your e-mail address now if you haven&#039;t in the form. If you don&#039;t have any comment I can tell you. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:35</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>I filled in the email address. I was just curious which was which. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You were right. The human was the first conversation. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:15</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>I had theory as to why the first was human, I just wanted to know. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:01</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>You taught your AI well if it could pick out the GoT theory! Very impressive. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you! ^.^ 
<span id="time-span">23:22:35</span><span id="name-span">Lady</span>Signing off! 
<span id="time-span">23:22:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright
