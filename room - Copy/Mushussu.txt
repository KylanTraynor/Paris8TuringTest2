<span id="time-span">01:43:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Mushussu. 
<span id="time-span">01:43:49</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Greetings 
<span id="time-span">01:43:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:11</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>No big deal, happy to help. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:25</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Okay. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">01:46:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">01:46:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">01:46:12</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">01:46:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:47:16</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Good day. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">01:47:36</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Faring well, besides the headache. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Did you take some drugs to help with tha t?
<span id="time-span">01:48:13</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Nah, I don&#039;t like to take pills. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Probably a good idea. It often stops with a good night of sleep anyway. 
<span id="time-span">01:49:02</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>I still don&#039;t like to, feels unpleasant. My body will deal with it, and like you said, sleep helps; I&#039;ll get some soon enough. 
<span id="time-span">01:49:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What will you do in the mean time? 
<span id="time-span">01:49:41</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Probably play more games. 
<span id="time-span">01:50:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds fun. I&#039;ll probably take a shower and watch some youtube videos. What kind of games? 
<span id="time-span">01:50:42</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>No Man&#039;s Sky as of current, maybe something else later though. 
<span id="time-span">01:51:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never heard of that game. What is it about? 
<span id="time-span">01:51:11</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Space exploration and survival. 
<span id="time-span">01:51:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh, is it the game where you can take off to space and build your ship? 
<span id="time-span">01:52:16</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Sort of, the building aspect isn&#039;t that large. Mostly exploration. 
<span id="time-span">01:52:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds nice. I&#039;ll have to try that 
<span id="time-span">01:52:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">01:52:56</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Okay. 
<span id="time-span">01:53:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">01:53:27</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>The AI. 
<span id="time-span">01:54:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again. 
<span id="time-span">01:54:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:54:26</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Greetings. 
<span id="time-span">01:54:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">01:54:50</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Quite fine, passing the time with games while I wait for a headache to subside. 
<span id="time-span">01:55:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh. Hopefully it will go with some rest. What kind of games? 
<span id="time-span">01:55:50</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>No Man&#039;s Sky, the space exploration and discovery game, released a few days ago. 
<span id="time-span">01:56:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard about it. Is it the one where you can build your ship and go to space from the ground? 
<span id="time-span">01:57:03</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>That is how it starts, you can add all sorts of tech, but there&#039;s no ship builder, as such. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Close enough I guess. I&#039;ll have to check it out. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:55</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>It&#039;s a bit expensive and buggy right now as it&#039;s a new, expected release; but I am loving my experience with it thus far. 
<span id="time-span">01:58:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How much is it? 
<span id="time-span">01:58:47</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Around 40 pounds. 
<span id="time-span">01:59:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mmm alright. I&#039;ll probably get it later. 
<span id="time-span">01:59:30</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>I&#039;d say it&#039;s worth it. 
<span id="time-span">01:59:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">01:59:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which conversation do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">01:59:56</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>The second conversation. 
<span id="time-span">02:00:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (this will be your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">02:00:19</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">02:01:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you for participating! Do you have any comments about your choice? 
<span id="time-span">02:01:07</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Well, was I right? 
<span id="time-span">02:01:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I&#039;ll tell you after comments you might give, to see what you&#039;re thinking without confirming or otherwise. 
<span id="time-span">02:02:42</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Hmm, comments? I&#039;m not sure, something about the first seemed more robotic It&#039;s hard to put my finger on it, the choice of language in the second just seemed a bit more humane. 
<span id="time-span">02:02:57</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Though there isn&#039;t much difference between them. 
<span id="time-span">02:03:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I see. Thanks for your comment! If you&#039;d like to see the results of this study when they are ready you can share your e-mail here if you didn&#039;t in the form. Otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">02:03:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>(You were right) 
<span id="time-span">02:04:25</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Hah, I thought so. Thanks for making me think a bit at least! 
<span id="time-span">02:04:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re welcome! 
<span id="time-span">02:04:50</span><span id="name-span">Mushussu</span>Have a nice day.
