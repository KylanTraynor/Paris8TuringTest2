<span id="time-span">17:17:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello DrakeZ. 
<span id="time-span">17:18:10</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">17:18:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:18:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">17:18:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">17:18:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:18:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">17:18:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">17:19:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">17:19:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">17:19:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">17:19:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">17:19:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">17:19:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">17:19:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">17:20:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">17:20:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">17:20:17</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>I understand 
<span id="time-span">17:20:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">17:20:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">17:20:51</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Hello there 
<span id="time-span">17:21:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">17:21:13</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Reasonably well, I&#039;d say. And you? 
<span id="time-span">17:21:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to today? 
<span id="time-span">17:21:41</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Well, talking to you, obviously. Otherwise not much 
<span id="time-span">17:22:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Alright. I&#039;m probably going to watch youtube videos and take a shower. 
<span id="time-span">17:22:40</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Do you prefer a shower over a bath then? 
<span id="time-span">17:23:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I prefer a bath, but I only have a shower. 
<span id="time-span">17:23:28</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Fair enough. 
<span id="time-span">17:23:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of shows do you like? 
<span id="time-span">17:23:56</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Comedy, mostly 
<span id="time-span">17:24:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Comedy is nice. 
<span id="time-span">17:24:30</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>So what were you up to yesterday? 
<span id="time-span">17:24:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much really. I had a hockey match. 
<span id="time-span">17:25:13</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>What position do you play? 
<span id="time-span">17:25:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you mean? 
<span id="time-span">17:25:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">17:26:06</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Alright 
<span id="time-span">17:26:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (this is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">17:27:12</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>I&#039;m not sure, though I&#039;d lean towards AI if I have to guess 
<span id="time-span">17:27:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again. 
<span id="time-span">17:27:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">17:28:00</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Hello Andrew 
<span id="time-span">17:28:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you? 
<span id="time-span">17:28:25</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Oh, somewhat somnolent 
<span id="time-span">17:28:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it late where you live? 
<span id="time-span">17:28:59</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>No, I&#039;ve been walking 
<span id="time-span">17:29:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. I hope it&#039;s not too hot outside. Here it is. 
<span id="time-span">17:29:52</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Oh? How hot is it where you are? 
<span id="time-span">17:30:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s about 90&deg;F. 
<span id="time-span">17:30:51</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>So what do you do for fun? 
<span id="time-span">17:31:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I play games, mostly RPG,  and hang out with friends.
<span id="time-span">17:32:04</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>Do you know what a pheasant is? I&#039;ve got one outside right now at the bird feeder 
<span id="time-span">17:32:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It must be quite a big bird feeder. The pheasants I saw were quite big. 
<span id="time-span">17:33:02</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>It eats what the little birds drop from the feeder 
<span id="time-span">17:33:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">17:33:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which conversation do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">17:34:19</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>It&#039;s hard to say, but I&#039;ll stick with my hunch and say the second one 
<span id="time-span">17:34:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you for participating! Do you have any comments you&#039;d like to share? 
<span id="time-span">17:36:13</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>I would have liked a little more time I think on both conversations, once the initial niceties are out of the way the remaining time to probe less... easily scriptable concepts is limited 
<span id="time-span">17:37:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I see. Thank you for your time! If you&#039;d like to see the results of the study once they are ready, you can share your e-mail here if you didn&#039;t in the form. Otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">17:38:00</span><span id="name-span">DrakeZ</span>I would like to see the results, it was quite interesting. I believe I shared my e-mail, so bye then
