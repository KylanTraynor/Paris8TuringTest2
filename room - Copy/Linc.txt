<span id="time-span">22:24:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Linc 
<span id="time-span">22:25:14</span><span id="name-span">Linc</span>Hello Moderator 
<span id="time-span">22:25:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:25:26</span><span id="name-span">Linc</span>You&#039;re welcome 
<span id="time-span">22:25:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">22:25:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">22:25:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:25:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">22:26:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">22:26:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">22:26:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">22:26:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">22:26:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">22:27:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">22:27:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">22:27:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">22:27:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">22:27:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">22:27:59</span><span id="name-span">Linc</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">22:28:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">22:28:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello.

<span id="time-span">22:34:30</span><span id="name-span">Linc</span>So far, a real person is doing well acting like a robot 
<span id="time-span">22:34:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>That doesn&#039;t answer my question. Human or IA? 
<span id="time-span">22:35:22</span><span id="name-span">Linc</span>Im going to go ahead and chose artificial 
<span id="time-span">22:36:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the second conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 5 minutes after your answer.

<span id="time-span">22:46:19</span><span id="name-span">Linc</span>Maybe it would be a good consideration to extend the testing time to 10 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">22:47:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thanks for your comment. We can&#039;t extend the testing time anymore, but we&#039;ll keep it in mind for another experiment. You can now close the window. Thank you again!
