<span id="time-span">05:12:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello ChaotixRocker. 
<span id="time-span">05:12:36</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">05:12:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">05:12:56</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>No problem 
<span id="time-span">05:13:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">05:13:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">05:13:21</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Sounds fair 
<span id="time-span">05:13:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">05:13:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">05:13:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">05:13:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">05:13:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">05:14:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">05:14:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">05:14:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">05:14:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">05:14:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">05:14:37</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>And I try to figure out which  is what?
<span id="time-span">05:14:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">05:14:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">05:15:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">05:15:33</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Sounds pretty easy: spend time with A and B then try to say who is which. 
<span id="time-span">05:16:10</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Correct? 
<span id="time-span">05:16:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">05:16:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">05:16:48</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Hey there. 
<span id="time-span">05:16:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">05:17:11</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Could be better, but I&#039;m alive. 
<span id="time-span">05:17:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s what matters. What&#039;s wrong? 
<span id="time-span">05:18:03</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Eh, usual worries. 
<span id="time-span">05:18:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Alright. What are you up to tonight? 
<span id="time-span">05:18:29</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>About 6 foot 2 
<span id="time-span">05:18:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sorry what? 
<span id="time-span">05:19:16</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>You asked what I was up to. I&#039;m up to about 6 feet 2 inches. 
<span id="time-span">05:19:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh. I meant what are you going to do tonight? 
<span id="time-span">05:20:06</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Not too much, chilling after working for 8 hours. 
<span id="time-span">05:20:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you do for work? 
<span id="time-span">05:20:42</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Cashier for a Home Depot 
<span id="time-span">05:21:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I work at a Deli. 
<span id="time-span">05:21:47</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Sounds fun, but I bet all of the cleaning gets annoying. 
<span id="time-span">05:21:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>T ime is up!
<span id="time-span">05:22:03</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Already 
<span id="time-span">05:22:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (this isn&#039;t your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">05:22:40</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Leaning towards the human 
<span id="time-span">05:23:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again. 
<span id="time-span">05:23:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">05:23:27</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Hey 
<span id="time-span">05:23:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">05:23:38</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Fair 
<span id="time-span">05:23:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nice. What are you up to tonight? 
<span id="time-span">05:24:19</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Same old thing, just on a different night. 
<span id="time-span">05:24:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds fun. 
<span id="time-span">05:24:46</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Meh 
<span id="time-span">05:24:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you watch any shows? 
<span id="time-span">05:25:10</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>A few 
<span id="time-span">05:25:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Like? 
<span id="time-span">05:26:14</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Cutthroat Kitchen, Flip or Flop, Guys Grocery Games, Tiny House Nation 
<span id="time-span">05:26:35</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Oh and Mythbusters 
<span id="time-span">05:26:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard of any of them. I mostly just watch Game of Thrones. 
<span id="time-span">05:27:05</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Don&#039;t have HBO 
<span id="time-span">05:27:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It can be expensive. 
<span id="time-span">05:27:54</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Yeah, but cel la vie 
<span id="time-span">05:28:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Are you French? 
<span id="time-span">05:28:29</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Nope 
<span id="time-span">05:28:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">05:28:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which of the two conversations do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">05:28:56</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Still leaning to 1st 
<span id="time-span">05:29:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (This will be your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">05:29:26</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">05:29:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you for participating! Do you have any comments you&#039;d like to share? 
<span id="time-span">05:29:57</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Nope 
<span id="time-span">05:30:21</span><span id="name-span">ChaotixRocker</span>Although, who was real? 
<span id="time-span">05:30:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Ok. If you&#039;d like to see the results of this study, you can share your email address here if you didn&#039;t in the form. Otherwise you can now close the window (You were right )
