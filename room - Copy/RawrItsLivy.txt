<span id="time-span">23:40:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello RawrItsLivy. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:19</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">23:40:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:41:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:41:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:41:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:41:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:41:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:43:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:43:04</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:43:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:43:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:43:42</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>Hi Andrew 
<span id="time-span">23:43:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:06</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>I&#039;m doing ok, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m alright. What are you up to this evening? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:50</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>I&#039;ve mostly been playing Overwatch. I&#039;ve leveled a lot today. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:45:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Just talking to you right now. I&#039;m going to take a shower and watch youtube videos though. 
<span id="time-span">23:46:10</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>What videos will you watch? 
<span id="time-span">23:46:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Game of Thrones Theories while I&#039;m waiting for season 7. 
<span id="time-span">23:46:55</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>Oh, I&#039;ve never watched GOT.  
<span id="time-span">23:47:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s quite good! It can be quite graphic sometimes though. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:56</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>The gore doesn&#039;t bother me at all. Just couldn&#039;t get into the show itself. 
<span id="time-span">23:48:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah. What kind of shows do you watch? 
<span id="time-span">23:48:37</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>I actually don&#039;t really watch T.V. much anymore. Mostly YouTube.  
<span id="time-span">23:48:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:49:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (Human or AI?) This is not your final answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:49:19</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>Human 
<span id="time-span">23:50:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. The other actor will start the next conversation. You&#039;ll have 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">23:50:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:50:14</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>Hi 
<span id="time-span">23:50:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:50:36</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>I&#039;m doing just dandy. What&#039;s up with you? 
<span id="time-span">23:51:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m just talking to you right now. What do you plan on doing this evening? 
<span id="time-span">23:51:46</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>Probably just hang out. I had a long day at work, so relaxing is really nice. Any plans on your end? 
<span id="time-span">23:52:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure yet. Probably just relaxing too. Like watching some youtube videos and taking a shower. 
<span id="time-span">23:53:22</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>It&#039;s too hot to even think about a shower right now. I have to wait until it gets a little cooler outside 
<span id="time-span">23:54:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Same here. A shower is a nice way to feel all fresh though. 
<span id="time-span">23:55:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:55:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which conversation do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">23:55:37</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>The first one 
<span id="time-span">23:55:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (This will be your final answer )
<span id="time-span">23:56:19</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:56:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright! Thank you for participating. Do you have any comments? 
<span id="time-span">23:56:53</span><span id="name-span">RawrItsLivy</span>No 
<span id="time-span">23:57:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>This is the end of the experiment, you can now feel free to close this window. Thank you again!
