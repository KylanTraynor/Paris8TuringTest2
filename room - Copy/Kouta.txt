<span id="time-span">00:29:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Kouta. 
<span id="time-span">00:29:50</span><span id="name-span">Kouta</span>hello 
<span id="time-span">00:30:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:30:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">00:30:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">00:30:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:30:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">00:31:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">00:31:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">00:31:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">00:31:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">00:31:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">00:32:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">00:32:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">00:32:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">00:32:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">00:32:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">00:32:56</span><span id="name-span">Kouta</span>I understand 
<span id="time-span">00:32:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">00:33:07</span><span id="name-span">Kouta</span>Okay 
<span id="time-span">00:33:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello!

<span id="time-span">00:36:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it an anime or something like that? 
<span id="time-span">00:37:11</span><span id="name-span">Kouta</span>Yah, the voice acting is pretty bad in it though 
<span id="time-span">00:37:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Even in the original version? 
<span id="time-span">00:37:41</span><span id="name-span">Kouta</span>well I don&#039;t know Japanese so It&#039;s hard to tell
