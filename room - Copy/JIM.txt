<span id="time-span">02:56:51</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">02:57:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello JIM. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:25</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>You&#039;re welcome 
<span id="time-span">02:57:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:47</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Okay 
<span id="time-span">02:57:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">02:58:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">02:58:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">02:58:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">02:58:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">02:58:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">02:58:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">02:59:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">02:59:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">02:59:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">02:59:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">02:59:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">03:00:02</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Yes I understand 
<span id="time-span">03:00:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">03:00:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:00:37</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">03:00:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">03:00:53</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Pretty good, and you? 
<span id="time-span">03:01:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">03:01:32</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Not much, just listening to music.  
<span id="time-span">03:01:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m probably going to watch some youtube videos myself. 
<span id="time-span">03:02:15</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Nice, what youtuber? 
<span id="time-span">03:02:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m watching Game of Thrones videos. Do you like that show? 
<span id="time-span">03:03:14</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>I&#039;ve never seen it but I want to. Probably just gonna wait until its on netflix 
<span id="time-span">03:03:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s quite good. It can get quite graphic though. 
<span id="time-span">03:03:53</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>I bet lol, I love tv shows and movies like that though 
<span id="time-span">03:04:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m basically just watching theories while I wait for season 7. What shows do you like? 
<span id="time-span">03:05:22</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>I don&#039;t watch tv so I don&#039;t know many. But I have watched all of Breaking Bad, Parks and Rec., Bones, Limitless, The Walking Dead  
<span id="time-span">03:05:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard about it. What is it about? 
<span id="time-span">03:06:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">03:06:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you were talking to? (this is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">03:06:42</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>The AI Actor 
<span id="time-span">03:07:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, and you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again. 
<span id="time-span">03:07:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:07:29</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Hello!

<span id="time-span">03:07:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">03:08:06</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Just listening to music. And you? 
<span id="time-span">03:08:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m just watching videos on youtube right now. 
<span id="time-span">03:08:33</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Nice, what youtuber? 
<span id="time-span">03:08:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s not really a youtuber. Just videos about Game of Thrones theories. 
<span id="time-span">03:09:18</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Ah okay, I&#039;ve heard its a good show 
<span id="time-span">03:09:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It definitely is! It can get quite graphic though. 
<span id="time-span">03:10:04</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>I bet, I&#039;ve heard of some of the things that go on it lol. But I like that kinda stuff  
<span id="time-span">03:10:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. I&#039;m waiting for season 7 right now. If you didn&#039;t watch it yet I won&#039;t spoil you. 
<span id="time-span">03:10:48</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>I haven&#039;t watched any of it at all 
<span id="time-span">03:11:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You should try it! 
<span id="time-span">03:11:29</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>I might when it comes to Netflix  
<span id="time-span">03:11:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it planned? 
<span id="time-span">03:11:54</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>I don&#039;t believe so 
<span id="time-span">03:12:06</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>I think Hulu owns the rights to it  
<span id="time-span">03:12:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You mean HBO? 
<span id="time-span">03:12:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">03:13:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which conversation do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">03:13:20</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>The second one 
<span id="time-span">03:13:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (This will be your final answer )
<span id="time-span">03:14:15</span><span id="name-span">JIM</span>Yes
