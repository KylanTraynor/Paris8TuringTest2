<span id="time-span">01:44:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello PokeLucas 
<span id="time-span">01:44:28</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">01:44:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:45</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Of course 
<span id="time-span">01:44:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">01:46:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">01:46:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">01:46:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">01:46:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">01:47:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">01:48:03</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">01:48:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:49</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">01:48:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">01:49:09</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>I am well, how about you? 
<span id="time-span">01:49:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m alright. 
<span id="time-span">01:49:58</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>What&#039;s up? 
<span id="time-span">01:50:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much really. Just talking to you. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">01:50:38</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Nothing much, doing the same. Talking to you. 
<span id="time-span">01:50:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ok. What do you like to do? 
<span id="time-span">01:51:35</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>In my spare time, I like to play video games. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">01:52:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly practicing baseball. Trying to keep my sch olarship as well.
<span id="time-span">01:52:57</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Are you currently in high school? Or elsewhere? 
<span id="time-span">01:53:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>In college actually. You? 
<span id="time-span">01:53:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">01:53:52</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Likewise, just finished my first semester in April. 
<span id="time-span">01:54:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you think you&#039;ve been talking to the Human or the Artificial Intelligence? (This is not your final answer. )
<span id="time-span">01:54:56</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Human 
<span id="time-span">01:55:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start with the second conversation. Andrew will start, and you&#039;ll have 5 minutes after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:55:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:56:05</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:56:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">01:56:23</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>I am well, how about you? 
<span id="time-span">01:56:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Doing decent. Just talking to you. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:09</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Always nice to have a conversation, right? 
<span id="time-span">01:57:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. It depends with whom though. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:50</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>True, not everyone if fun to speak to. 
<span id="time-span">01:58:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not everyone is fun. 
<span id="time-span">01:58:46</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>They can&#039;t all be fun. That&#039;s what makes us all unique! 
<span id="time-span">01:59:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I guess. Except when you have to speak to lots of people 
<span id="time-span">02:00:09</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Does that make you nervous? 
<span id="time-span">02:00:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It does. And it does not. 
<span id="time-span">02:00:41</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Interesting, I agree. 
<span id="time-span">02:00:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you like to do? 
<span id="time-span">02:01:05</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Hang out with friends usually, you? 
<span id="time-span">02:01:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">02:01:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>What is your final answer? Do you think the first conversation was the one with the human? Or was it with an Artificial Intelligence? 
<span id="time-span">02:02:09</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>I believe the first conversation was with the human. 
<span id="time-span">02:02:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Is it your final answer? 
<span id="time-span">02:02:32</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">02:02:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you very much for your participation! 
<span id="time-span">02:02:58</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>You are very welcome! 
<span id="time-span">02:03:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Would you like to see the results of the study? (If you&#039;ve given us your e-mail )
<span id="time-span">02:03:21</span><span id="name-span">PokeLucas</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">02:03:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll send them to you when it will be ready. You can now close this tab.
