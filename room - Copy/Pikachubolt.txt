<span id="time-span">01:13:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Pikachubolt. 
<span id="time-span">01:14:02</span><span id="name-span">Pikachubolt</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">01:14:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:14:21</span><span id="name-span">Pikachubolt</span>No problem 
<span id="time-span">01:14:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">01:14:30</span><span id="name-span">Pikachubolt</span>okay 
<span id="time-span">01:14:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">01:14:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:14:40</span><span id="name-span">Pikachubolt</span>okay 
<span id="time-span">01:14:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">01:14:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">01:15:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">01:15:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">01:15:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">01:15:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">01:15:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">01:15:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">01:15:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">01:16:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">01:16:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">01:16:22</span><span id="name-span">Pikachubolt</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">01:16:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:16:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello!

<span id="time-span">01:20:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It kind of sounds like Dexter.

<span id="time-span">01:21:50</span><span id="name-span">Pikachubolt</span>The American one doesn&#039;t have that good of a selection.  I got bored with them after a while
