<span id="time-span">02:48:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Waffles. 
<span id="time-span">02:49:07</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">02:49:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">02:49:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">02:49:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">02:49:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">02:50:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">02:50:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">02:50:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">02:50:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">02:50:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">02:51:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">02:51:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">02:51:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">02:51:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">02:51:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">02:52:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">02:52:09</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">02:52:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">02:52:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello. 
<span id="time-span">02:52:55</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Hi 
<span id="time-span">02:53:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">02:53:15</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>I&#039;m doing fine thanks, and you? 
<span id="time-span">02:53:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">02:53:56</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Just watching a TV show.  What about you? 
<span id="time-span">02:54:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much really. Just talking to you at the moment. 
<span id="time-span">02:54:45</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>What are your plans for the rest of the day? 
<span id="time-span">02:55:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m probably just going to watch TV. There is a good show tonight. 
<span id="time-span">02:55:42</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>What show? 
<span id="time-span">02:56:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Game of Thrones. The new season. I&#039;m catching up on the last episodes. 
<span id="time-span">02:56:41</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Nice, that&#039;s one of my favorite shows.  Who&#039;s your favorite character? 
<span id="time-span">02:57:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I like Tyrion. But I don&#039;t think that&#039;s quite a surprise. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:47</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>He&#039;s one of my favorites also. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Who is yours? 
<span id="time-span">02:58:25</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Daenerys for sure 
<span id="time-span">02:58:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">02:58:54</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Okay 
<span id="time-span">02:59:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you think you were talking to the human or to the Artificial Intelligence? (This is not your final answer. )
<span id="time-span">02:59:32</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Artificial Intelligence 
<span id="time-span">03:00:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will start and you will have 5 minutes to talk to him.

<span id="time-span">03:04:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s cool. I like baseball. Do you like sports? 
<span id="time-span">03:04:32</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>Not really, I don&#039;t play or watch them. 
<span id="time-span">03:04:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Are you good at it? 
<span id="time-span">03:05:16</span><span id="name-span">Waffles</span>At sports? No. 
<span id="time-span">03:05:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sorry. I&#039;m a bit confused. Drank a bit too much.

<span id="time-span">03:06:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure?
