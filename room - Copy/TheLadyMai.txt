<span id="time-span">03:38:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello TheLadyMai. 
<span id="time-span">03:38:47</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>hello 
<span id="time-span">03:38:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">03:39:00</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>you are welcome 
<span id="time-span">03:39:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the little &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">03:39:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">03:39:11</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Okay 
<span id="time-span">03:39:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">03:39:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">03:39:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">03:39:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">03:40:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">03:40:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">03:40:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">03:40:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">03:40:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">03:40:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 5 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">03:40:47</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Okay 
<span id="time-span">03:40:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">03:41:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">03:41:07</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">03:41:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 5 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">03:41:41</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">03:41:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:41:51</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Hey there 
<span id="time-span">03:42:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">03:42:19</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>I am doing okay, just ate dinner. How are you? 
<span id="time-span">03:43:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. Just about to watch videos on youtube and take a shower. What did you eat? 
<span id="time-span">03:43:33</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Burger and fries. What kind of videos do you like to watch? I love Jenna Marbles 
<span id="time-span">03:44:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Lately I&#039;ve mostly been watching Game of Thrones theories on youtube. It helps waste some time while I wait for season 7. 
<span id="time-span">03:44:48</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>I love game of thrones! Im still catching up but I ready and watch spoiilers 
<span id="time-span">03:45:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How far are you into it? 
<span id="time-span">03:45:49</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>I got to season 4 or 5 i think but its been so long that i am rewatching it. So currently Im in season 2 
<span id="time-span">03:46:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Rewatching helps notice lots of details you didn&#039;t see the first time. 
<span id="time-span">03:46:36</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>For sure 
<span id="time-span">03:46:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">03:47:09</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Okay 
<span id="time-span">03:47:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? (This is not your final answer )
<span id="time-span">03:47:48</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Um artifical 
<span id="time-span">03:48:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin. After your answer you&#039;ll have 5 minutes again. 
<span id="time-span">03:48:34</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Okay 
<span id="time-span">03:48:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:48:47</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Hey there! 
<span id="time-span">03:48:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">03:49:11</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Im doing good. Just ate a burger and now Im ready for a nap 
<span id="time-span">03:49:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds good! I&#039;m probably going to watch some youtube videos and take a shower. 
<span id="time-span">03:50:18</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Youtube is always fun! What do you like to watch? 
<span id="time-span">03:50:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly Game of Thrones theories right now while I wait for season 7. 
<span id="time-span">03:51:17</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Its a tough wait. Think Jon Snow and Daenary are related? 
<span id="time-span">03:51:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How far are you into it? 
<span id="time-span">03:52:04</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Im rewatching it so Im on season 2 
<span id="time-span">03:52:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I won&#039;t answer your question then. I don&#039;t give spoilers. 
<span id="time-span">03:53:36</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>I read and watch spoilers. Im bad at avoiding them 
<span id="time-span">03:53:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Then you already know the answer I&#039;m sure. 
<span id="time-span">03:53:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">03:54:05</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>OKay 
<span id="time-span">03:54:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which of the two conversations do you think was with the human? 
<span id="time-span">03:54:52</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Oh Im awful at this. I think the second was the human 
<span id="time-span">03:55:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you sure? (This will be your final answer )
<span id="time-span">03:55:18</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">03:55:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thanks for participating! Do you have any comments you&#039;d like to share? 
<span id="time-span">03:55:58</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>This game/test is hard. Do I get to know which is human? 
<span id="time-span">03:56:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You were right! 
<span id="time-span">03:56:57</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Oh cool! 
<span id="time-span">03:57:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you surprised? 
<span id="time-span">03:57:27</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Kind of. It was hard to tell 
<span id="time-span">03:57:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>How did you figure out? 
<span id="time-span">03:58:47</span><span id="name-span">TheLadyMai</span>Um kind of guessed. But the game of throne theory part may have been it 
<span id="time-span">03:59:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you again! You can now close this window. If you&#039;d like to see the results of this study, you can share your e-mail address if you didn&#039;t in the form
