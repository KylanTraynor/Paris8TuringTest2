Moderator,0,0,"Welcome JustAFox. ",18,
Moderator,11,11,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,32,21,"If you can see this, please type &quot;Yes&quot; ",49,
JustAFox,57,25,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,63,6,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,71,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
JustAFox,75,4,"Okay. Go ahead. ",16,
Moderator,80,5,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,89,9,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,97,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,106,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,114,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,123,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,131,8,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,138,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,146,8,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,153,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,161,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,170,9,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,178,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,187,9,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
JustAFox,197,10,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,203,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
JustAFox,210,7,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,217,7,"Hello! ",7,
JustAFox,246,29,"Hello there my friend. How was your day, what did you to today? ",64,1
Andrew,275,29,"It&#039;s been quite alright thank you! Played a couple of games and stuff. What about you? ",92,1
JustAFox,361,86,"Hmm, what kind of games did you play and why did you prefer to stay inside when there&#039;s 20 degress outside with an all blue sky? I went  to work since it&#039;s Tuesday.",174,1
Andrew,485,124,"Well, I don&#039;t have much to do outside to be honest right now. I&#039;ve been so busy that I try to relax. I&#039;ve been playing Mass Effect mostly. ",154,1
JustAFox,556,71,"Not having spring feelings? Come one. All blue sky and hot temperatures? Isn&#039;t that inviting? ",99,1
Andrew,613,57,"Well, here in Canada it&#039;s not that hot. Where do you live? ",64,1
JustAFox,697,84,"would  you like to guess where I live? ",39,1
Andrew,722,25,"I can try. ",11,1
JustAFox,750,28,"I give you a hint: the wall. ",29,1
Andrew,773,23,"Trump&#039;s wall? ",19,1
JustAFox,798,25,"Next hint: more that 20 years ago ",34,1
Andrew,830,32,"I don&#039;t really know. ",26,1
JustAFox,859,29,"Do you want another hint? ",26,1
Andrew,866,7,"Sure yes. ",10,1
JustAFox,910,44,"There was something called american sector. ",44,1
Andrew,933,23,"Oh yeah? ",9,1
JustAFox,950,17,"Yes. There was also a russian and an french sector ",51,1
Andrew,1007,57,"Oh yeah. You&#039;re talking about Berlin right? ",49,1
JustAFox,1036,29,"Right. What was the hint that made you recognise it? ",53,1
Andrew,1054,18,"The last one I guess. ",22,1
JustAFox,1067,13,"Do you have access to google? ",30,1
Andrew,1081,14,"Not right now no. ",18,1
JustAFox,1124,43,"Do you have a specific piece of history you enjoy? ",51,1
Moderator,1153,29,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1168,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
JustAFox,1267,99,"I think you&#039;re the AI. In case you&#039;re not, plese don&#039;t feel offended.I guess the real actor would have at least known about the wall and such much quicker. ",171,
Moderator,1282,15,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
JustAFox,1327,45,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1337,10,"Hello! ",7,
JustAFox,1357,20,"Hello there buddy. How was the weather today? ",46,2
Andrew,1391,34,"It was decent I guess. A rather good day for Ontario to be honest. ",67,2
JustAFox,1419,28,"Was it sunny or just less cold? ",32,2
Andrew,1462,43,"It was sunny actually. About 59&deg; too. ",42,2
JustAFox,1509,47,"You&#039;re talking about fahrenheit, I guess? ",47,2
Andrew,1539,30,"Oh yeah sorry. I&#039;m not sure how much that is in celsius. Something like 10? ",81,2
JustAFox,1573,34,"Can you convert that from Fahrenheit to Celsius for me? ",56,2
Andrew,1599,26,"I think I just did. I&#039;m not sure about the exact formula though. ",70,2
JustAFox,1653,54,"There comes something else to my mind. It&#039;s about this conversation. May I suggest another hint for the rules? ",116,2
Andrew,1673,20,"What do you mean? ",18,2
JustAFox,1723,50,"Do you know about a character limit regarding the char input window? ",69,2
Andrew,1744,21,"I know there is one. I&#039;m not sure how many that is. ",57,2
JustAFox,1816,72,"It&#039;d come handy to know about beforehand. ",47,2
Andrew,1834,18,"Ah ok. ",7,2
JustAFox,1901,67,"You know, it&#039;s a tad annoying to have something great in mind and not being able to elaborate on it. ",106,2
Andrew,1921,20,"You can&#039;t make it shorter? ",32,2
JustAFox,1971,50,"I had to. Was no fun. ",22,2
Andrew,2007,36,"I believe it&#039;s to make sure people don&#039;t write a book or something like that. ",88,2
JustAFox,2043,36,"isn&#039;t that a bit unpolite? ",32,2
Andrew,2071,28,"Why would it be? ",17,2
JustAFox,2098,27,"How&#039;d you feel about not being able to express yourself? ",62,2
Andrew,2128,30,"I&#039;ve heard someone say constraints trigger creativity. ",60,2
JustAFox,2198,70,"Only if the outcome is worth the effort. ",41,2
Andrew,2220,22,"Well, what was your idea about? ",32,2
Moderator,2264,44,"Time is up! ",12,
JustAFox,2264,0,"About explaining how my day was. Something awesome happened where I was today for most of the time. ",100,
Moderator,2285,21,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
JustAFox,2323,38,"Is my time over? ",17,
Moderator,2343,20,"Yes. It was over just before your answer ",41,
JustAFox,2374,31,"The first conversation was the AI I think. ",43,
Moderator,2389,15,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
JustAFox,2427,38,"5 ",2,
Moderator,2438,11,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,
JustAFox,2456,18,"can you tell me which one was the AI? ",38,
Moderator,2461,5,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window. ",116,
Moderator,2470,9,"I can tell you if you have no comments anymore. ",48,
