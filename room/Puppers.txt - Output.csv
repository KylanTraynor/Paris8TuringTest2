Puppers,8,8,"? ",2,
Moderator,17,9,"Welcome Puppers. ",17,
Puppers,27,10,"hello ",6,
Moderator,35,8,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,46,11,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,51,5,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,59,8,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,67,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,73,6,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,82,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,90,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,97,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,104,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,113,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,121,8,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,130,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,138,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,146,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,163,17,"Do not type more than one post at a time. ",42,

Puppers,519,42,"I think you&#039;re the bot. Should we keep going or do we stop if I call it? ",78,1
Moderator,555,36,"[if you want to stop, say it explicitely] ",42,1
Andrew,609,54,"I&#039;m not sure why you think I&#039;m a bot. ",48,1
Puppers,619,10,"I want to stop because I have concluded that you are the bot actor ",67,1
Moderator,629,10,"Conversation Interrupted! ",26,
Puppers,660,31,"Did I get it right or wrong? ",29,

Andrew,1209,52,"I have a couple of friends there too. It&#039;s either too hot or way too cold. ",80,2
Puppers,1261,52,"I never heard him complain about too hot... but then its easily 100 F here in the summer so maybe he doesn&#039;t bother trying to complain about heat to me ",157,2
Andrew,1290,29,"When you&#039;re used to the cold, just above freezing is decent. ",66,2
