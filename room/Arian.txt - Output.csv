Moderator,0,0,"Hello Arian ",12,
Arian,1,1,"Hello? ",7,
Moderator,5,4,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,21,16,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Arian,25,4,"Yes. ",5,
Moderator,28,3,"Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",110,
Moderator,35,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Arian,45,10,"Okay. ",6,
Moderator,47,2,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,54,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,60,6,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,67,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,72,5,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,80,8,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,85,5,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,91,6,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,96,5,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,103,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,110,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,115,5,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,122,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,127,5,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Arian,148,21,"I think so, yes. Do I talk to both actors at the same time, or one at a time? ",78,
Moderator,182,34,"One at a time. It will be in two conversations, each lasting up to 15 minutes. ",79,
Arian,194,12,"Alright, I think I understand it fully. ",40,
Moderator,204,10,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Arian,210,6,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,218,8,"Hello! ",7,
Arian,225,7,"Hello! You are Andrew? ",23,1
Andrew,245,20,"I am yes! Nice to meet you. How are you doing? ",47,1
Arian,256,11,"I&#039;m doing well. How about you? ",36,1
Andrew,273,17,"I&#039;m doing quite alright. What are you up to today? ",56,1
Arian,301,28,"Well, not much. I&#039;m just playing some video games and relaxing.  ",70,1
Andrew,339,38,"Nice. Which game do you play? ",30,1
Arian,352,13,"League of Legends. Have you heard of it? ",41,1
Andrew,371,19,"Yeah I&#039;ve definitely heard of it. Never actually played it though. ",72,1
Arian,403,32,"It&#039;s challenging. Well, what do you like to do? ",53,1
Andrew,442,39,"I waste a lot of my time playing Minecraft. I&#039;m really fond of building things. ",85,1
Arian,481,39,"I used to play Minecraft a lot, I like those kind of video games.  ",67,1
Andrew,510,29,"Yeah. I play on a server online. Makes it much more interesting. Otherwise it can get quite boring. ",100,1
Arian,546,36,"Yeah, and there are a lot of fun servers to try out.  ",54,1
Andrew,578,32,"I actually own one. It&#039;s a fantasy/medieval themed server. ",64,1
Arian,604,26,"That&#039;s cool! Is it for roleplaying? ",41,1
Andrew,647,43,"To some extent yes. It&#039;s survival, but takes a lot of inspiration from Game of Thrones and also has some aspects of creative mode in it. ",142,1
Arian,686,39,"How long have you been playing on it? Are there any cool structures you&#039;re proud of? ",90,1
Andrew,737,51,"Yeah plenty. I&#039;ve been working on it for about two years I believe, we&#039;re still developing it though. ",112,1
Arian,837,100,"Are there any other games you like to play? ",44,1
Andrew,874,37,"I recently finished the last Mass Effect. I also play city builders and things like that. ",90,1
Arian,919,45,"I love city builders, I used to play Simcity 3000 a lot. Do you play Cities: Skylines? ",87,1
Andrew,966,47,"Yeah I did! Haven&#039;t played it in a little bit though. I get a bit overwhelmed with mods. ",94,1
Arian,1034,68,"[STOP] ",7,1
Moderator,1047,13,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,1063,16,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Arian,1095,32,"I think I&#039;ve been talking to the human. ",45,
Moderator,1115,20,"Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? ",141,
Arian,1122,7,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,1130,8,"Hello! ",7,

Andrew,1182,21,"I&#039;m doing quite alright! What are you up to? ",50,2
Arian,1200,18,"Well, I&#039;m just relaxing a bit before bed. What are you doing? ",67,2
Andrew,1225,25,"Not much actually. Considering playing a game or something like that. ",70,2
Arian,1266,41,"What kinds of games do you enjoy? ",34,2
Andrew,1298,32,"Mostly RPGs, and I also like city builders and sandbox games like Minecraft. How about you? ",92,2
Arian,1323,25,"I like strategy games, simulators, and also MOBAs. I was playing League of Legends earlier. ",92,2
Andrew,1365,42,"I never played that game. I&#039;ve definitely heard of it though. ",67,2
Arian,1459,94,"It can be fun. It&#039;s definitely challenging, and sometimes really stressful. The community is very competitive and sometimes mean. ",135,2
Andrew,1501,42,"Right, that&#039;s the case with most online games actually. ",61,2
Arian,1546,45,"Yeah! Especially competitive games.  ",37,2
Andrew,1610,64,"I&#039;m usually not too fond of those. I prefer following a story. ",68,2
Arian,1638,28,"Is that why you like RPGs? What are some of your favorites? ",60,2
Andrew,1681,43,"I&#039;d say Final Fantasy and Mass Effect are my favorites. I really love their stories. ",90,2
Arian,1793,112,"I haven&#039;t actually played many of those games, but I hear good things. A good story can captivate me, though. That&#039;s why I like Visual Novels. ",153,2
Andrew,1852,59,"What kind of Visual Novels do you like? ",40,2
Arian,1927,75,"I like the Ace Attorney series, and also the Zero Escape series. Have you heard of those? ",90,2

Arian,1974,31,"Have you played any Visual Novels before? ",42,2
Andrew,2013,39,"Some Telltale games yes, like the Game of Thrones one. ",55,2
Moderator,2049,36,"Time is up! ",12,
Arian,2067,18,"Ah, okay. ",10,
Moderator,2068,1,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Arian,2077,9,"I think it was the human. ",26,
Moderator,2091,14,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? ",89,
Arian,2117,26,"I think... 4.  ",15,
Moderator,2129,12,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2136,7,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  ",118,
Arian,2158,22,"Cool! Only comment I have would be, what&#039;s the purpose of this study? If you&#039;re comfortable sharing. ",111,
Moderator,2216,58,"We&#039;re trying to study the influence of different parameters on the feeling of humaneness given by an artificial intelligence. ",131,
Arian,2248,32,"Hmm. Well, it was definitely interesting. Am I allowed to know if I was right, or am I told later? ",99,
Moderator,2268,20,"If you don&#039;t have any more comment I can tell you right now yes. ",70,
Arian,2302,34,"Yeah, I don&#039;t have any more comments. It was fun, and I think either way it was a very good AI! ",101,
Moderator,2319,17,"Alright. The first conversation was the one with the human! ",60,
