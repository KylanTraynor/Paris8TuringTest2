<span id="time-span">23:16:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello ErikaTheZebra! 
<span id="time-span">23:16:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study! 
<span id="time-span">23:16:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:16:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">23:20:12</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I can now~  Sorry about that 
<span id="time-span">23:20:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>No problem. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">23:22:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:22:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:23:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:23:10</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:23:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:23:25</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I am ready 
<span id="time-span">23:23:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:23:53</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Hello~ 
<span id="time-span">23:24:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:24:24</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I&#039;m alright, how&#039;re you? 
<span id="time-span">23:24:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright too! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:25:09</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Currently wasting time by watching youtube videos. 
<span id="time-span">23:25:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah I know the feeling. I do that quite a lot as well. What kind of things do you watch? 
<span id="time-span">23:26:22</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Right now, I&#039;m watching Joel from Vinesauce play that awful Klingon FMV game from a while back. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard of that game. I do like Vinesauce a lot too though! 
<span id="time-span">23:27:19</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Which of the Vinesauce streamers is your favorite? 
<span id="time-span">23:28:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not really sure actually. It really depends on the video. 
<span id="time-span">23:29:33</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Fair enough.  I think Vinny is my favorite out of the lot. 
<span id="time-span">23:29:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I definitely like his voice, and the corruption videos are quite awesome. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:15</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I mostly like his garbage sunday streams.  Some of the stuff that people send him is truly terrible 
<span id="time-span">23:32:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s very true yeah. Are there other youtubers you like to watch? I follow a lot of minecraft related ones myself. Game of Thrones theories are awesome too. 
<span id="time-span">23:33:38</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Honestly, aside from the core Vinesauce Streamsers and Idubbbbz, I don&#039;t closely follow any other youttubers. 
<span id="time-span">23:34:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ah I see. Do you play any video games, or do you prefer just watching others play? 
<span id="time-span">23:35:53</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I used to play a lot more games back in the day, but I don&#039;t much anymore.  I was playing Skyrim before hopping on here though. 
<span id="time-span">23:36:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I liked Skyrim a lot. I&#039;ve spent a lot less time on it than I did on Oblivion though. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:40</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I actually didn&#039;t play through Oblivion properly until I finished Skyrim.  I appreciate how much more is in Oblivion than in Skyrim. 
<span id="time-span">23:38:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The world mostly seemed a bit more vibrant and interesting to me. But I might be biased because it was my first Elders&#039; Scrolls. 
<span id="time-span">23:39:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:39:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">23:40:16</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Well, at first I wanted to say it was a human before of a grammatical error, but then it was constant, so I want to say it was the AI. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:40:58</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">23:41:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:41:17</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Hello~ 
<span id="time-span">23:41:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:41:32</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I 
<span id="time-span">23:41:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You? 
<span id="time-span">23:41:58</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Whoops.  I&#039;m doing alright, how&#039;re you? 
<span id="time-span">23:42:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright too! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:42:38</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I&#039;m currently wasting time on youtube with various youtube videos 
<span id="time-span">23:43:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah, I do that a lot too actually. What are you watching? 
<span id="time-span">23:43:45</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>At this current moment, just watching complete trash.  I&#039;ll be going back to watching Joel in a moment though. 
<span id="time-span">23:44:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Joel? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:30</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>One of the Vinesauce streamers.  Usually the second most popular of the lot 
<span id="time-span">23:44:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see! I quite like Vinesauce actually. 
<span id="time-span">23:45:26</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Which of the Vinesauce  streamers is your favorite?
<span id="time-span">23:45:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t know if I really have one actually. You? 
<span id="time-span">23:46:40</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>That&#039;s a hard decision, but I think I&#039;d have to choose Vinny  
<span id="time-span">23:46:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Why Vinny? 
<span id="time-span">23:47:47</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Well, he pumps out the most content and he&#039;s generally a really funny guy, despite how much  he craps on himself.
<span id="time-span">23:48:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah I see. 
<span id="time-span">23:51:27</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>[stop ]
<span id="time-span">23:51:39</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I believe  I have a guess
<span id="time-span">23:51:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation Interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">23:51:59</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>The one I just talked to was the AI 
<span id="time-span">23:52:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">23:52:20</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>5 
<span id="time-span">23:52:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">23:52:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  
<span id="time-span">23:53:09</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Oh, alrighty~  Did I guess right? 
<span id="time-span">23:53:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can tell you after your comments, or if you don&#039;t have any I can tell you right now. 
<span id="time-span">23:54:52</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>I think the only comment I can make is that I mostly based my decision on the second Andrew&#039;s supposed lack of knowledge of Vinesauce.  There&#039;s no real reason to give an AI knowledge of a Let&#039;s Player
<span id="time-span">23:55:08</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>That&#039;s all I have to add 
<span id="time-span">23:55:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. The AI was indeed the second one! 
<span id="time-span">23:55:56</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>Heh, who knew watching some obscure Let&#039;s Player would help me out. 
<span id="time-span">23:55:59</span><span id="name-span">ErikaTheZebra</span>That was fun 
<span id="time-span">23:56:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Glad that you enjoyed it!
