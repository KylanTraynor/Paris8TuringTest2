<span id="time-span">21:18:22</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Ehm 
<span id="time-span">21:18:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Zyran. 
<span id="time-span">21:18:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">21:19:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">21:19:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">21:19:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">21:19:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">21:19:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">21:19:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">21:19:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">21:20:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">21:20:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">21:20:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">21:20:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">21:20:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">21:20:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">21:20:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">21:21:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">21:21:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">21:21:17</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>I guess so.  
<span id="time-span">21:21:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">21:21:32</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Yep 
<span id="time-span">21:21:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">21:21:49</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Hi 
<span id="time-span">21:21:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">21:22:16</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>I&#039;m good :-) Who is supposed to be leading the conversation during this test? :-)  
<span id="time-span">21:22:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>[Please don&#039;t use smileys] 
<span id="time-span">21:22:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, no one has to lead actually. We can just chat. 
<span id="time-span">21:23:17</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Okay, then. And how are you doing?  
<span id="time-span">21:23:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What about you? 
<span id="time-span">21:24:00</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>As I&#039;ve said, I&#039;m good.  
<span id="time-span">21:24:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah sorry I got distracted. What&#039;s up though? 
<span id="time-span">21:25:05</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Nothing much, my brother sent this to me like 5 minutes ago. Guess I&#039;m just killing my time here.  
<span id="time-span">21:25:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ah I see. You you play video games? 
<span id="time-span">21:25:51</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>I do, name me a few that you&#039;ve played lately, if you do too . 
<span id="time-span">21:26:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Lately I&#039;ve been playing a lot of Mass Effect. I mostly play Minecraft. 
<span id="time-span">21:27:18</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Yeah, I&#039;ve already played through the whole new Mass Effect that just came out. I&#039;m a videogame reviewer.  
<span id="time-span">21:28:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What did you think about it? And that&#039;s quite cool. 
<span id="time-span">21:29:07</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Not bad, not awesome. Gave it 7/10. Slighty above average.  
<span id="time-span">21:30:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s always hard to start a new series. I think it&#039;s not a bad start to a new trilogy to be honest. 
<span id="time-span">21:31:05</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Yeah, the ending talked to me into giving it a 7. Otherwise, I&#039;d just give it a 6. What time did we start this test, do you know?  
<span id="time-span">21:31:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No I have no idea sorry. What did you like about the ending? 
<span id="time-span">21:33:20</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>The atmosphere. But let&#039;s change the subject. I wanna know if you&#039;re a bot or a human actually.  
<span id="time-span">21:33:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m a human obviously. 
<span id="time-span">21:34:01</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>That&#039;s what a robot would say, as well.  
<span id="time-span">21:34:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It would be dumb to say that I&#039;m a bot though. But probably yes. 
<span id="time-span">21:35:21</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Unless you were a human and you would want to confuse me. That way you would say that you are a bot.  
<span id="time-span">21:36:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m supposed to convince you that I&#039;m the human, not confuse you. Mind you the bot would say the same since we have the same goal. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">21:36:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">21:37:09</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Human 
<span id="time-span">21:37:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">21:37:29</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">21:37:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">21:37:54</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Oh you again!  
<span id="time-span">21:38:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I could say the same! 
<span id="time-span">21:38:31</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>And you can!  
<span id="time-span">21:38:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you? 
<span id="time-span">21:39:02</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Crap, ruined the joke... I&#039;m doing alright, how about you?  
<span id="time-span">21:39:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite alright! What joke did you have planned though? 
<span id="time-span">21:40:36</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Nevermind. So, if there are actual humans in this test. How many of actual real beings are there?  
<span id="time-span">21:41:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Technically there&#039;s 3. You, me and the moderator. 
<span id="time-span">21:42:04</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>I know, but there obviously has to be a team of people. If one Andrew is supposed to be a real human, then there has to be a lot of people taking shifts for the real Andrew.  
<span id="time-span">21:43:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nope, I&#039;m actually the only Andrew around. No replacements. 
<span id="time-span">21:44:40</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>And how many people are acting as the real Andrew? If we put aside our little conversation here, I&#039;m just curious about the project.  
<span id="time-span">21:45:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well I just told you. I&#039;m the only one. 
<span id="time-span">21:46:36</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>And if, for example, 5 other people would be taking the test and they just finished talking to the robot Andrew, they are supposed to wait in line for the real one?  
<span id="time-span">21:47:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yes. That&#039;s why we&#039;re only having one person at a time. 
<span id="time-span">21:47:19</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Oh I didn&#039;t know that.  
<span id="time-span">21:47:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well now you do. 
<span id="time-span">21:47:50</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>How long are you doing this?  
<span id="time-span">21:48:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Until we&#039;ve got enough data. I&#039;m not sure yet how long it will take. 
<span id="time-span">21:49:09</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Is this well-knows, this project? Never heard of it.  
<span id="time-span">21:49:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Wait what? 
<span id="time-span">21:50:14</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Yeah, my brother sent this to me, but I&#039;ve never heard of it before.  
<span id="time-span">21:50:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Why would you have heard of it? 
<span id="time-span">21:51:54</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>So are you surprised I haven&#039;t heard of it or surprised that I thought I should have heard of it?  
<span id="time-span">21:52:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No I misunderstood your first question. I now understand that you meant well known. And no it&#039;s not public, so there is no way you would have heard about it. 
<span id="time-span">21:53:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">21:53:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">21:53:18</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Robot 
<span id="time-span">21:53:23</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>wait 
<span id="time-span">21:53:33</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>First conversation - human 
<span id="time-span">21:53:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">21:54:18</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Can I remake my answer? 
<span id="time-span">21:54:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">21:54:35</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Human (first conversation) 
<span id="time-span">21:54:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I understood that yes. 
<span id="time-span">21:54:56</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>6 
<span id="time-span">21:55:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">21:55:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">21:56:30</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>When am I gonna know who was the robot ? In those coming months? 
<span id="time-span">21:56:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You can know now if you have no comment, or after your comments. 
<span id="time-span">21:57:13</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Ok, I&#039;d like to know.  
<span id="time-span">21:57:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The human was the second one. 
<span id="time-span">21:57:39</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Wow 
<span id="time-span">21:58:18</span><span id="name-span">Zyran</span>Ok then, goodbye and good luck with the project 
<span id="time-span">21:58:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you very much! Good bye and good luck with yours.
