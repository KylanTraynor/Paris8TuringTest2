<span id="time-span">01:46:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome M.Trucker.Bear. 
<span id="time-span">01:46:27</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">01:46:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:46:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:13</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Okay 
<span id="time-span">01:47:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice.  
<span id="time-span">01:47:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">01:48:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:49:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">01:49:05</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">01:49:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:49:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">01:49:28</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">01:49:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:49:39</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Hi! 
<span id="time-span">01:49:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">01:49:56</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>I&#039;m not sure. 
<span id="time-span">01:50:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh? Is there something wrong? 
<span id="time-span">01:50:26</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Yes my father has late stage dementia.  I authorized hospice care for him today. 
<span id="time-span">01:50:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh... I&#039;m sorry to hear that. 
<span id="time-span">01:51:29</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>It&#039;s sad that he will be passing soon, but I&#039;m relieved to know that the horizon for the end of his suffering is visible.  I&#039;m not sure if that makes me a bad person or not. 
<span id="time-span">01:52:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I think it&#039;s quite understandable really. You need to live, and it&#039;s better to live knowing that you don&#039;t have to worry about the pain of people you care about. 
<span id="time-span">01:53:03</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Have you had any relatives with dementia? 
<span id="time-span">01:53:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t, no. 
<span id="time-span">01:53:43</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>That&#039;s relieving to hear.   It&#039;s a terribly unsettling disease. 
<span id="time-span">01:54:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve had a friend with the pathological case of depression, but that&#039;s a different disease. 
<span id="time-span">01:55:42</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Quite.  I&#039;ve had friends who have suffered from clinical depression as well.  I&#039;m sorry you had to go through that.  It is difficult having somebody who you can&#039;t help no matter what you try. 
<span id="time-span">01:56:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I imagine on that aspect of it at least, depression and dementia aren&#039;t that different. Maybe the intensity though. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:33</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Is your friend okay? 
<span id="time-span">01:58:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>He was alright the last time we talked yes. It&#039;s his birthday soon. 
<span id="time-span">01:58:54</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Good.  How do I stop this conversation? 
<span id="time-span">01:59:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation Interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">01:59:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">01:59:24</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>AI 
<span id="time-span">02:00:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, and you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">02:00:08</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">02:00:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">02:00:19</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Hi! 
<span id="time-span">02:00:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">02:01:03</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>I&#039;m okay.  I took my car into the shop today and learned that it needs new tires, and that it will cost $500 to replace a side mirror.   
<span id="time-span">02:01:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Damn. Always nice to have unexpected things to spend money on. 
<span id="time-span">02:02:23</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>For a certain value of nice.  A small value of nice.  How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">02:02:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. 
<span id="time-span">02:03:30</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Any unexpected expenses like mine hit you recently? 
<span id="time-span">02:04:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Had our two cars drop dead mid-January, other than that no. 
<span id="time-span">02:04:49</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Two is especially unlucky, especially if you live where January is winter.   
<span id="time-span">02:05:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. We only replaced one though. 
<span id="time-span">02:06:15</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>What killed them? 
<span id="time-span">02:07:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not really sure actually. 
<span id="time-span">02:08:16</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>That&#039;s surprising.  You didn&#039;t have a mechanic or a automotively inclined person (yourself included) investigate them? 
<span id="time-span">02:08:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>They are my mother&#039;s cars. I just take the bus. 
<span id="time-span">02:09:38</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Do you have any questions for me? 
<span id="time-span">02:10:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not feeling really creative, they might be boring. 
<span id="time-span">02:10:30</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>That&#039;s fine 
<span id="time-span">02:10:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What are you up to tonight? 
<span id="time-span">02:11:41</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>I&#039;m going to go to the gym and then have dinner at home with my husband.  
<span id="time-span">02:12:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That sounds quite nice actually. 
<span id="time-span">02:13:16</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Then I&#039;ll probably do some work on a D&amp;D character for this Saturday&#039;s game. 
<span id="time-span">02:13:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never played D&amp;D before. 
<span id="time-span">02:14:15</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>It&#039;s fun with the right group of players. 
<span id="time-span">02:14:24</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>Otherwise it is a tremendous bore. 
<span id="time-span">02:14:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>[Please keep it to one post only] 
<span id="time-span">02:14:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I can understand that yeah. 
<span id="time-span">02:15:32</span><span id="name-span">M.Trucker.Bear</span>stop conversation 
<span id="time-span">02:15:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">02:15:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?

<span id="time-span">02:16:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer?
