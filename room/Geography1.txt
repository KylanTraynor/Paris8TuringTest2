<span id="time-span">15:00:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Geography1! 
<span id="time-span">15:01:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study! 
<span id="time-span">15:01:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">15:01:19</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>I&#039;m curious to see how it works,  and yes, I can read this. 
<span id="time-span">15:01:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">15:01:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">15:01:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">15:03:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">15:03:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">15:03:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">15:03:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">15:03:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">15:03:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">15:03:44</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Yes, I do. 
<span id="time-span">15:03:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">15:03:53</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">15:04:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">15:04:12</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Hello to you as well. 
<span id="time-span">15:04:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">15:04:28</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>I&#039;m doing well, thanks. 
<span id="time-span">15:04:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Cool! What are you up to today? 
<span id="time-span">15:05:07</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>I&#039;m browsing the internet, stumbled across this and it seemed interesting. 
<span id="time-span">15:05:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I take It you&#039;re interested by AI stuff in general? 
<span id="time-span">15:07:09</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>I&#039;ve seen fictional portrayals.  Things like HAL in the movie 2001.   Often they get used as a literal Deus Ex Machina for the plot of a story, or to reflect a kind of Pandora&#039;s Box type story.   
<span id="time-span">15:08:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah, most of the time they are portrayed as evil things that should be destroyed. Also more recently as things that could be useful like Jarvis in Iron Man. What&#039;s your take on that? 
<span id="time-span">15:10:19</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>I only saw the first two movies.  I thought he seemed sub-sentient in that situation.   Certainly Tony Stark treated him that way.  I didn&#039;t find his character to be that important to the plot. 
<span id="time-span">15:11:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah he seemed to be intelligent, but not really an individual entity. More like a super developed Siri. Do you play games? Mass Effect has a very interesting take on all of this. 
<span id="time-span">15:13:04</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Kind of...  Mass Effect at least managed to say that digital life could be as diverse as biological life, except for when it&#039;s primary villians declared that it must always rebel against its creators.
<span id="time-span">15:14:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah, the ending was a bit weird in that sense. Didn&#039;t really fit with the rest of the story. 
<span id="time-span">15:14:48</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Multiple writers, multiple visions.  It happens. 
<span id="time-span">15:15:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Happened with the last one too, in one single game. 
<span id="time-span">15:15:35</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Haven&#039;t played that one yet.  My game budget has diminished since I had kids. 
<span id="time-span">15:16:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I can imagine. Probably less time too. How many kids do you have? 
<span id="time-span">15:16:54</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Two,  one of each gender.  It&#039;s early here so I get a little free time before they wake. 
<span id="time-span">15:17:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah, it&#039;s 9:17 here. I&#039;m in Canada. You? 
<span id="time-span">15:18:39</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>West Coast US.   I wondered given the fact the &quot;Universite&quot; is French.  Quebec? 
<span id="time-span">15:19:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No, that university has little to do with me personally. I&#039;m just helping. 
<span id="time-span">15:19:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">15:19:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">15:19:45</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Human. 
<span id="time-span">15:19:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">15:20:03</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">15:20:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">15:20:46</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Good Morning. 
<span id="time-span">15:20:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">15:21:06</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>I&#039;m doing quite fine,  how about you? 
<span id="time-span">15:21:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What are you up to today? I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks. 
<span id="time-span">15:22:10</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Just browsing the internet, came across this and I was curious to see what the differences might be and if an AI could pass a Turing test. 
<span id="time-span">15:23:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You seem to have some knowledge about that. I take it you&#039;re interested in AI? 
<span id="time-span">15:23:57</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Some knowledge yes.    Not much beyond the most basic ideas and what&#039;s been in some movies or books.  HAL from 2001 for example. 
<span id="time-span">15:25:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I watched it a few months ago though. I only have few memories of this movie actually. 
<span id="time-span">15:26:32</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Oh?   That few memories sounds a little like the kind of conversational dodge an AI would use to avoid detailed questions that require human context. 
<span id="time-span">15:28:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Or it could just be that it didn&#039;t really grab my attention that much. Kind of like 2001: The Space Odyssey. 
<span id="time-span">15:29:53</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>It&#039;s also a very long movie.  They don&#039;t make them with specific seating music and an intermission anymore. 
<span id="time-span">15:31:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Although both had very interesting technical features, It just seemed very slow and a bit boring. 
<span id="time-span">15:32:51</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>[STOP] 
<span id="time-span">15:33:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">15:33:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">15:33:39</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>Human 
<span id="time-span">15:33:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">15:33:49</span><span id="name-span">Geography1</span>6 
<span id="time-span">15:33:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">15:34:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.
