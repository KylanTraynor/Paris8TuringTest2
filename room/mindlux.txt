<span id="time-span">17:05:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello mindlux. 
<span id="time-span">17:06:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:06:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">17:06:54</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>yes i am 
<span id="time-span">17:07:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">17:07:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">17:07:08</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">17:07:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:07:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">17:07:25</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">17:07:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">17:07:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">17:07:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">17:07:49</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>yep 
<span id="time-span">17:07:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">17:07:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">17:08:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">17:08:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">17:08:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">17:08:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">17:08:31</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>got it 
<span id="time-span">17:08:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">17:08:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">17:08:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">17:09:19</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>stop to stop no links one post at a time 
<span id="time-span">17:09:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes exactly 
<span id="time-span">17:10:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">17:10:11</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>just checking 
<span id="time-span">17:10:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Let me know 
<span id="time-span">17:11:14</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>so it two different chats? or one where the actor and the bot take turns 
<span id="time-span">17:11:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>It&#039;s two different chats. 
<span id="time-span">17:11:52</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>ok ready 
<span id="time-span">17:12:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">17:12:11</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>hello how are you? 
<span id="time-span">17:12:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">17:12:44</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>pretty good just on my computer late at night 
<span id="time-span">17:13:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span> Oh? What time is it for you? 
<span id="time-span">17:13:14</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>almost 1 am 
<span id="time-span">17:13:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s late indeed. It&#039;s 11am for me. 
<span id="time-span">17:13:58</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>ah timezones 
<span id="time-span">17:14:15</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>are you aware that you are an ai? 
<span id="time-span">17:14:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not one. 
<span id="time-span">17:14:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>[ Make sure you keep it to one post ] 
<span id="time-span">17:15:29</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>say if you are one can i test you for it? 
<span id="time-span">17:15:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not, but sure feel free. 
<span id="time-span">17:16:37</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>can you answer some questions?  
<span id="time-span">17:16:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup! 
<span id="time-span">17:19:33</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>true or false this answer is wrong? 
<span id="time-span">17:20:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What you&#039;re asking doesn&#039;t make any sense. 
<span id="time-span">17:22:03</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>think through it step by step what does it mean? 
<span id="time-span">17:24:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>True or false, so you give me two possibilities. This answer is wrong? I assume that is the question. 
<span id="time-span">17:25:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>[ The actor will follow the same rules, and can&#039;t answer more than one post ] 
<span id="time-span">17:27:03</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>but there could be a third answer the world is not black and white  
<span id="time-span">17:27:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">17:27:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">17:29:07</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>i feel like it was the ai text construction was spot on but it had issue with a common  logic puzzle 
<span id="time-span">17:29:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">17:29:49</span><span id="name-span">mindlux</span>yeah sure 
<span id="time-span">17:29:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello!
