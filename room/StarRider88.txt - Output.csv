StarRider88,0,0,Hello. ,7,
Moderator,10,10,Welcome StarRider88 ,20,
Moderator,25,15,Thank you for participating in this study. ,43,
Moderator,43,18,"If you can see this, please say Yes ",36,
StarRider88,206,163,Yes ,4,
Moderator,222,16,"Perfect. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",113,
Moderator,230,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,241,11,You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ,131,
Moderator,249,8,You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ,37,
StarRider88,257,8,That sounds good. Are you the guy who sent me the link? ,56,
Moderator,261,4,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,275,14,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,285,10,We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ,67,
Moderator,294,9,The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ,67,
Moderator,303,9,You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ,51,
Moderator,310,7,Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ,120,
Moderator,320,10,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,330,10,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,337,7,Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ,91,
Moderator,344,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,352,8,Do not type more than one post at a time. ,42,
Moderator,362,10,Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ,53,
StarRider88,371,9,Yes I do. ,10,
Moderator,379,8,Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ,102,
StarRider88,392,13,Yes. ,5,
Andrew,396,4,Hello! ,7,
StarRider88,0,10,"Hi, Andrew. How are you doing? ",31,1
Andrew,13,13,I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! How about you? ,52,1
StarRider88,38,25,I&#039;m doing great. I just got done playing Guitar Hero on the Wii. ,70,1
Andrew,56,18,Oh nice! I haven&#039;t played that in a very long while. ,58,1
StarRider88,81,25,Oh really? I was playing Legends of Rock. Which song is your favorite on there? ,80,1
Andrew,111,30,I honestly don&#039;t remember any of them. I just remember that it was really hard. ,85,1
StarRider88,154,43,It&#039;s only hard if you choose to play on Hard. ,51,1
Andrew,205,51,I found it hard to do even on normal. But I never played it long enough to really learn the buttons. ,101,1
StarRider88,265,60,Ah. Do you have a job? ,23,1
Andrew,304,39,"Kind of. I&#039;m a student, but I work at a KFC to pay for tuition. ",69,1
StarRider88,352,48,Haha KFC. I&#039;m also a student. What college to you go to if you don&#039;t mind me asking? ,95,1
Andrew,376,24,"I study Biology at the University of Western, Ontario. ",55,1
StarRider88,401,25,Oh nice. I don&#039;t really have a major yet. I go to Santa Rosa Junior College in California. ,96,1
Andrew,438,37,What would you like to study? ,30,1
StarRider88,531,93,I&#039;d probably like to study astrophysics and veterinary sciences. Only problem is that both involve lots of math. Also considering geology. ,144,1
Andrew,561,30,That sounds really awesome actually. I study biology and neurosciences. ,72,1
StarRider88,587,26,Biology? Nice. When I was little I wanted to be a biologist. ,61,1
Andrew,606,19,Sounds like you want to do everything. ,39,1
StarRider88,737,131,Haha yeah. I&#039;m a huge science guy. My favorite subject is astronomy. I just love the universe and I want to know more about it. If only it didn&#039;t require so much math. ,178,1
Andrew,813,76,"Many things in sciences require maths anyway, but it&#039;s true that astronomy might require more than others. I&#039;m not really an expert on the topic. ",156,1
StarRider88,840,27,"Yeah. By the way, can I ask you a question?  ",45,1
Andrew,854,14,Of course! ,11,1
StarRider88,864,10,"Which letter of the English alphabet flies, sings, and stings? ",63,1
Moderator,899,35,Time is up! ,12,
Moderator,911,12,Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ,85,
StarRider88,955,44,The human. ,11,
Moderator,1000,45,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",135,
StarRider88,1060,60,Yes. ,5,
Andrew,1066,6,Hello! ,7,
StarRider88,1117,51,"Hi, Andrew. How are you? ",25,2
Andrew,1131,14,I&#039;m alright thanks. You? ,30,2
StarRider88,1189,58,I&#039;m doing great. Time expired in the last conversation before the actor could answer my question. ,103,2
Andrew,1211,22,What was the question? ,23,2
StarRider88,1234,23," Which letter of the English alphabet flies, sings, and stings? ",64,2
Andrew,1256,22,B. ,3,2
StarRider88,1283,27,Wow. You&#039;re really good. I didn&#039;t think you could answer trick questions. ,84,2
Andrew,1295,12,Why not? ,9,2
StarRider88,1331,36,I don&#039;t know. Thought maybe a trick question could trip the AI up.  ,73,2
Andrew,1355,24,"Well, I&#039;m not the AI so... ",32,2
StarRider88,1405,50,"I&#039;m going to take that with a grain of salt because for all I know, you&#039;re lying to me. Why would the actor give me the answer to the experiment? ",156,2
Andrew,1439,34,Maybe to make it easier for you. ,33,2
StarRider88,1493,54,I doubt it. That would ruin the experiment. Let&#039;s try this question. Which one is correct? &ldquo;Penguins flies&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Penguin flies&rdquo; ,158,2
Andrew,1514,21,The second one. ,16,2
StarRider88,1529,15,Wrong. Neither is correct. Penguins don&#039;t fly. ,52,2
Andrew,1559,30,That&#039;s a good point. It was grammatically correct though. ,63,2
StarRider88,1594,35,Yes that&#039;s true. But that wasn&#039;t the answer to the trick question. ,77,2
Andrew,1647,53,Yup. Doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m an AI though. ,46,2
StarRider88,1717,70,"Of course it doesn&#039;t. But here is another question. If God is all powerful and can do anything, can he create a boulder so heavy, that even he can&#039;t lift it? ",168,2
Andrew,1775,58,There is no valid answer to this. ,34,2
StarRider88,1834,59,"Correct, because the question is a paradox. Anyway, enough with the trick questions. Let&#039;s learn about you. Do you have a job or go to school? ",148,2
Andrew,1856,22,Yeah. I&#039;m a student and work at a KFC. ,44,2
StarRider88,1925,69,"Cool. What kind of video games do you play, if you play any? ",61,2
Andrew,1950,25,ROGs and City Builders in general. ,35,2
StarRider88,1991,41,"Cool. I&#039;ve never played either. So, do you remember anything we talked about in the previous conversation? ",112,2
Andrew,2005,14,What do you mean? ,18,2
Moderator,2034,29,Time is up! ,12,
Moderator,2046,12,Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ,81,
StarRider88,2183,137,The AI. ,8,
Moderator,2197,14,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
StarRider88,2219,22,4.5 ,4,
Moderator,2236,17,I only accept integer values. 4 or 5? ,38,
StarRider88,2265,29,4 ,2,
Moderator,2276,11,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,
Moderator,2297,21,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise, you can close this window. ",108,
StarRider88,2432,135,I really enjoyed this experiment. The Andrew in the second conversation said that he wasn&#039;t the AI after I mentioned I thought an AI would trip up over a trick question. Now THAT tripped me up. Haha. ,205,
StarRider88,2443,11,"Overall, very enjoyable.  ",26,
Moderator,2469,26,Thank you. You can now close this window. ,42,
