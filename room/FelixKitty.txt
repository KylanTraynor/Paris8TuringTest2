<span id="time-span">14:10:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome FelixKitty 
<span id="time-span">14:10:12</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Test 
<span id="time-span">14:10:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">14:10:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">14:10:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">14:10:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">14:10:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">14:10:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">14:11:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">14:12:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">14:12:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">14:12:14</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>YEs 
<span id="time-span">14:12:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">14:12:26</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">14:12:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">14:12:39</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Hello there! 
<span id="time-span">14:12:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">14:12:58</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>I&#039;m doing alright, how about yourself? 
<span id="time-span">14:13:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">14:13:24</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Nothing much right now, myself. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">14:13:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ah alright. I&#039;m playing a little bit of Minecraft. 
<span id="time-span">14:14:12</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Oh nice! Up to anything neat with it? 
<span id="time-span">14:14:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve been walking around in circle for a bit now. I&#039;m not sure yet. 
<span id="time-span">14:14:47</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Trying to decide what to build? 
<span id="time-span">14:15:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you play it too? Yeah pretty much. 
<span id="time-span">14:15:37</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>I do, though not as much as I used to. I haven&#039;t had the motivation to work on my projects 
<span id="time-span">14:15:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of projects? 
<span id="time-span">14:16:26</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>One&#039;s a starship, another is a light rail network, and the third one is a custom recreation of a facility from a book I read in middle school 
<span id="time-span">14:17:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How long have you been working on those? That is pretty cool actually. 
<span id="time-span">14:17:56</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>The first two, on and off since 2013. The other one, I started late last year and haven&#039;t come very far with it 
<span id="time-span">14:18:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That must be a very big airship. That&#039;s a lot of work then! 
<span id="time-span">14:19:47</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Yup! And it&#039;s all been by hand, which is a huge factor of the time to build these projects. 
<span id="time-span">14:20:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah. There are ways to make it a lot easier. You&#039;ve never been tempted to? 
<span id="time-span">14:20:52</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>I&#039;ve been tempted, but I view it as sort of cheating the effort really. Plus, it&#039;s easier if I have to go back and redesign something. 
<span id="time-span">14:21:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You don&#039;t play survival at all? And yeah fair enough. 
<span id="time-span">14:22:35</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>I play it here and there, but it&#039;s vanilla Minecraft when I do 
<span id="time-span">14:23:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you play on a server at all? It can be quite boring. 
<span id="time-span">14:23:48</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Not usually. Most of the time it&#039;s by myself. 
<span id="time-span">14:24:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That might be why you have a lack of motivation. 
<span id="time-span">14:24:41</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Maybe, but part of it is just not knowing where to go from where I&#039;m at now 
<span id="time-span">14:25:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you play anything else? Yeah I see. 
<span id="time-span">14:25:57</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Not too many other games really. I&#039;m not much of a gamer.  
<span id="time-span">14:26:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you like to be doing? 
<span id="time-span">14:26:51</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Mostly chatting online, or building stuff in Lego Digital Designer. 
<span id="time-span">14:27:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What is that? I&#039;ve never heard of it. 
<span id="time-span">14:27:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">14:28:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">14:28:40</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>The Artificial Intelligence 
<span id="time-span">14:28:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">14:28:56</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">14:29:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">14:29:20</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Hiya! 
<span id="time-span">14:29:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">14:29:39</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>I&#039;m alright, how about yourself? 
<span id="time-span">14:29:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">14:30:06</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Nothing too much really. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">14:30:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not doing much. I might just play a bit of Minecraft. 
<span id="time-span">14:31:05</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Oh? Anything in particular you might do in it? 
<span id="time-span">14:31:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not entirely sure yet actually. But I&#039;m open for ideas! 
<span id="time-span">14:32:10</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Well, are you playing Survival? Or creative? 
<span id="time-span">14:32:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I play a bit of both. I&#039;m on a server actually most of the time. 
<span id="time-span">14:32:46</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Oh nice. What sort of server? 
<span id="time-span">14:33:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s basically a medieval themed server, and a bit of a RPG. 
<span id="time-span">14:33:54</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Oh, that&#039;s cool! 
<span id="time-span">14:34:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah, it also tries to bring some creative aspect within the difficulty of survival. 
<span id="time-span">14:35:37</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Nice! I mostly stick to single player, myself 
<span id="time-span">14:36:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I find it more fun playing with others. It gets old very fast if I play on my own. 
<span id="time-span">14:37:07</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Fair enough. It works for me since I&#039;m usually the only one with the schematics for what I&#039;m building in my head 
<span id="time-span">14:37:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah, it&#039;s hard working with other people. It helps being on a call at the same time. 
<span id="time-span">14:38:13</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Yeah, that&#039;s true. Makes it easier to coordinate 
<span id="time-span">14:38:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of things do you like to build? Medieval buildings too? 
<span id="time-span">14:39:18</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Nah, mostly modern/futuristic stuff myself. 
<span id="time-span">14:39:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. It can be quite cool as well, and less common. 
<span id="time-span">14:40:21</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Yup. Especially with mods to make things a bit easier to build 
<span id="time-span">14:41:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Which mods do you use? I used to like one that made you able to build ships. 
<span id="time-span">14:42:24</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>Mostly mods to increase the capabilities of Redstone, and for aesthetic stuff. ProjectRed for example 
<span id="time-span">14:42:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard of it actually. 
<span id="time-span">14:43:42</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>It&#039;s a good one. It gives you better components to work with, such as wire and stuff, and also lets you take a giant redstone circuit and put it into one plate. 
<span id="time-span">14:44:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah it&#039;s sounds pretty cool actually! I should try it. 
<span id="time-span">14:44:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">14:44:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the FIRST conversation?  
<span id="time-span">14:44:58</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>The Artificial Intelligence 
<span id="time-span">14:45:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">14:45:28</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>6 
<span id="time-span">14:45:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">14:46:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise, you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">14:46:47</span><span id="name-span">FelixKitty</span>THe second Andrew felt more fluid, the conversation more human. The first one felt a bit choppy, and I couldn&#039;t see an actual human player just aimlessly going in circles in Minecraft. 
<span id="time-span">14:47:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Alright! Thank you!
