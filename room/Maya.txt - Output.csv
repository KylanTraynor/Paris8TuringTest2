Moderator,0,0,"Hello Maya. ",12,
Moderator,4,4,"Hello Maya. ",12,
Moderator,8,4,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Maya,16,8,"Hi Mr. Moderator! ",18,
Moderator,28,12,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Maya,41,13,"Are you a bot too? ",19,
Moderator,41,0,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,58,17,"No I&#039;m not. I just have pre-defined speech to say. ",56,
Moderator,72,14,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,89,17,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,97,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,105,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,114,9,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Maya,116,2,"Am I supposed/allowed to ask questions designed to &quot;break&quot; the AI, basically? ",88,
Moderator,126,10,"You&#039;re welcome to yes. ",28,
Moderator,133,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,160,27,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,160,0,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,173,13,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,183,10,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,191,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,199,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,206,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,214,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,220,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Maya,258,38,"I usually use emotes/smilies in my text messages as a habit. To make sure, you&#039;re telling me to keep them out of my messages, yes? ",136,
Moderator,280,22,"That is correct yes. It&#039;s in order to keep it fair to both the AI and the Human. ",86,
Maya,313,33,"All right. Anything else, any punctuation you&#039;d normally expect in text is fair game? ",91,
Moderator,344,31,"Anything else is fair game. Try to keep talking to the character of Andrew though, and not the actors directly. ",112,
Maya,351,7,"What about typos/&quot;weird&quot; phrasing? Can I use that in order to try to confuse a bot with something a human would be able to understand? ",145,
Moderator,367,16,"Yes you can do that too. ",25,
Maya,389,22,"Okay. I think I&#039;m clear on the rules now. ",47,
Moderator,397,8,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Maya,403,6,"I am. ",6,
Andrew,409,6,"Hello! ",7,1
Maya,415,6,"Hi Andrew! ",11,1
Andrew,422,7,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Maya,438,16,"I&#039;m fine, thank you. A little excited about all of this. How about you? ",77,1
Andrew,463,25,"I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! A bit tired though, glad that you&#039;re excited! ",88,1
Maya,477,14,"Tired? What&#039;s the time where you are? ",43,1
Andrew,509,32,"It&#039;s not that late actually. I just had a long day. It&#039;s 8 pm. ",73,1
Maya,550,41,"8pm? What&#039;s that in &quot;real&quot; time units? None of that 12h stuff! ",78,1
Andrew,591,41,"That&#039;s 20:12 to be accurate. How about you? ",49,1
Maya,642,51,"2:13! That would put you in...GMT-5 DST I assume. East Coast? ",62,1
Andrew,682,40,"Wow that&#039;s pretty late for you. And yeah, I live in the Ontario (Canada). ",79,1
Maya,724,42,"Yeah, I tend to stay up pretty late. What itme do you usually go? ",66,1
Andrew,763,39,"Like, go to bed? Usually around midnight. ",42,1
Maya,801,38,"What d&#039;you work as then? ",30,1
Andrew,830,29,"I don&#039;t really work anymore actually. It&#039;s summer break for me. I&#039;m just having rough nights. ",109,1
Maya,859,29,"Bad draeam problems? ",21,1
Andrew,925,66,"Not really, it&#039;s more like I can&#039;t sleep. I end up trapped on youtube. ",81,1
Maya,953,28,"Hah! What sorts of stuff do you go for there? ",46,1
Andrew,1041,88,"It can be very random. Sometimes just music videos, other times videos about the president on the other side of the border... Random. ",134,1
Maya,1070,29,"May I ask wht you think about him? ",35,1
Andrew,1100,30,"He&#039;s entertaining to watch at least. What do you think? ",61,1
Maya,1166,66,"I think he&#039;s a smart guy posing to be dumb for publicity. And it&#039;s working. Did you hear about his Tweet, with that supposed &quot;typo&quot;? ",153,1
Andrew,1205,39,"I&#039;m not sure. What was it about? ",38,1
Maya,1272,67,"Supposedly he mistyped &quot;coverage&quot; as &quot;covfefe&quot;. And now it&#039;s all over the web, people calling him oh, so stupid, when it&#039;s obvious that that&#039;s a publicity stunt. Or do you believe that? ",221,1
Moderator,1332,60,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1352,20,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Maya,1379,27,"Can I quickly look back at the messages, or would you like me to make a gut decision now? ",90,
Moderator,1400,21,"I can wait. This is not your final answer anyway. ",50,
Maya,1479,79,"There&#039;s some indication either way. I&#039;d be pretty impressed if a bot got the 12-24h thing right the way I phrased it, but then I&#039;d imagine everyone would&#039;ve heard of that tweet since it was all... ",217,
Maya,1487,8,"...over the web. ",17,
Maya,1521,34,"I&#039;m really interested to see the other person-slash-bot now though. Since they&#039;re playing the same character, this might shed some more light on it for me. ",166,
Maya,1553,32,"After this, I can&#039;t say for sure though. If I *had* to guess, I&#039;d say human, but it&#039;s difficult. ",112,
Moderator,1586,33,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
Maya,1591,5,"Yep! ",5,
Andrew,1608,17,"Hello! ",7,
Maya,1615,7,"Hi Andrew! ",11,2
Andrew,1625,10,"How are you doing? ",19,2
Maya,1644,19,"I&#039;m fine. Intrigued. And yourself ?",40,2
Andrew,1658,14,"I&#039;m quite alright, thanks. ",32,2
Maya,1691,33,"What have you been up to today? ",32,2
Andrew,1736,45,"Had a lot of work to do on the house. Pretty tiring. ",53,2
Maya,1754,18,"Oh? New house or just renovai tons?",35,2
Andrew,1772,18,"Just renovations yeah. ",23,2
Maya,1808,36,"Sorry for the random spaces, the chat seems to insert those when I delete and add a letter. Let me tset that. ",110,2
Andrew,1834,26,"No worries. ",12,2
Maya,1850,16,"Yeah, it didn&#039;t seem to happen there anyway. Just my luck! ",64,2
Andrew,1875,25,"And you, how was your day? ",27,2
Maya,1930,55,"My day...pretty relaxed to be honest. I work a lot, so I just decided to take a day off now, especially since it&#039;s the weekend and all. What do oyu work as? ",162,2
Andrew,1963,33,"I study biology, but I&#039;m in summer break. ",47,2
Maya,1998,35,"I see! What kinds of jobs can you look towards with that? ",58,2
Andrew,2030,32,"Mostly research. I&#039;m particularly interested in neurobiology. ",67,2
Maya,2047,17,"Does it  pay well?",18,2
Andrew,2060,13,"Not really. But it&#039;s interesting. ",39,2
Maya,2074,14,"Money not your primary objective then? ",39,2
Andrew,2121,47,"I prefer working for something motivating yes. ",47,2
Maya,2140,19,"So where in the world are you? ",31,2
Andrew,2157,17,"Canada. How about you? ",23,2
Maya,2175,18,"Austria! Quite the distance. What&#039;s the time for you then? ",64,2
Andrew,2206,31,"It&#039;s 8:40pm right now. ",28,2
Maya,2222,16,"Can you give me that in &quot;real&quot; time units? We don&#039;t understand that 12h stuff here! ",99,2
Andrew,2237,15,"20:40 ",6,2
Maya,2275,38,"Ah, thank you. So six hours behind me. You&#039;re quite a bit further up north, is it as hot there as it is ehere? ",116,2
Andrew,2321,46,"It&#039;s rather hot right now yeah. For Canada. ",49,2
Maya,2339,18,"Oh? How hot? Again, I&#039;ll need &quot;real&quot; units if possible! ",71,2
Andrew,2387,48,"It&#039;s about 30&deg;C. ",26,2
Maya,2401,14,"Whewf. Got an AC? ",18,2
Andrew,2428,27,"Thank god yes. ",15,2
Maya,2441,13,"What&#039;s your comfort tempreture then? ",42,2
Andrew,2475,34,"Around 20&deg;C I guess. ",25,2
Maya,2492,17,"Oh my. You must be working that poor AC to death! ",50,2
Moderator,2533,41,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2551,18,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the FIRST conversation? ",80,
Maya,2608,57,"Well, it&#039;s definitely not a crystal clear choice. Either way, it&#039;s a really good AI. ",95,
Maya,2627,19,"But since I have to guess, I&#039;ll say the first one was the human. And I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;ve just called someone a robot! ",131,
Moderator,2662,35,"On a scale from 1 (not certain at all) to 7 (absolutely sure) how confident are you of your choice? ",100,
Maya,2699,37,"I&#039;d say around a 4. My gut says the first one was the human, but analytically, I really don&#039;t know. ",110,
Moderator,2747,48,"Alright. Thanks a lot for participating. If you&#039;ve given an e-mail address you&#039;ll receive the general results of this study once it will be completed. ",161,
Moderator,2762,15,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise, you can close this window. ",108,
Maya,2764,2,"Will you tell me whether I was right? ",38,
Maya,2773,9,"Cause I&#039;m actually pretty damn curious! ",45,
Moderator,2786,13,"I can tell you after your comments, or right now if you don&#039;t have any. ",77,
Maya,2824,38,"My only comment is that this has been super interesting, and while I expected this to be difficult, I also expected to be able to catch the bot off-guard with some &quot;meaner&quot; questions. ",194,
Maya,2832,8,"Then again I&#039;m not an expert on AI, but still. I&#039;m impressed. ",72,
Moderator,2884,52,"I&#039;m glad that you are. The first conversation was indeed with the human. ",78,
Maya,2901,17,"All right. Would you like me to share the things I think tipped me off a little? ",81,
Moderator,2914,13,"Sure! ",6,
Maya,2968,54,"All right, so, it *was* pretty impressive that it understood my request to put it into 24h time and centigrade the way I phrased it. ",133,
Maya,2990,22,"It&#039;s answers just...seemed a tiny bit too cold. Had I not had the conversation with the human as well, I might&#039;ve thought it&#039;s just that kind of personality though. ",180,
Maya,3014,24,"But compared to &quot;the other Andrew&quot;, it was just something that tipped me off a little. ",97,
Maya,3055,41,"Like, when I tried to take the conversation into a slightly more humorous manner, it didn&#039;t respond to that at all. ",121,
Maya,3075,20,"Like I said, it could indicate just that kind of personality, but the first Andrew did, and in comparison it just made the other one seem a bit cold. ",150,
Moderator,3101,26,"I see, It does make perfect sense yes. ",39,
Maya,3129,28,"Just like when he responded to my request with a plain &quot;20:40&quot;. Some humans would act like that, yes, but when put next to an actual human, it can often seem a little cold. ",183,
Maya,3162,33,"Because they would tend to embellish it, be nice, say &quot;Oh, of course, it&#039;s 20:40.&quot; and maybe even make an off-hand comment about how silly the different time systems are. ",186,
Maya,3176,14,"Or get back at me for ridiculing 12h somehow in a playful manner, depending on personality. ",92,
Moderator,3199,23,"Right, (am/pm is quite a ridiculous system XD) ",47,
Maya,3225,26,"I think that&#039;s about it. Easy for me to say, but make it seem a little...warmer and that might just be it. ",112,
Maya,3246,21,"And without the direct comparison to a human it would likely have fooled me. ",77,
Moderator,3267,21,"Thanks a lot for your comments, and thank you again for participating, especially that late for you. ",101,
Maya,3300,33,"It&#039;s fine. It was super interesting, and I hope I could help a bit. Anything else I can do? ",97,
Moderator,3340,40,"Maybe talk about it to people you know, especially within the next 3 days ^^ ",77,
Moderator,3365,25,"(also, if you could poke me again where we first talked together) ",66,
Maya,3367,2,"Oh I am! Not giving them any hints of course, just letting them know it&#039;s a thing and pointing them your way. ",115,
Moderator,3450,83,"Thanks again, you can now close this window. ",45,
