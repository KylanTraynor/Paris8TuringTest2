Moderator,0,0,"Welcome Page! ",14,
Moderator,19,19,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,39,20,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Page,46,7,"Yes. ",5,
Moderator,56,10,"Good, In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",110,
Moderator,66,10,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,76,10,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,83,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,92,9,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,99,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,108,9,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,115,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,122,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,129,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,136,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,153,17,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,161,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,174,13,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,181,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,187,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Page,199,12,"Yes. ",5,
Moderator,205,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Page,224,19,"Yep. ",5,
Andrew,229,5,"Hello! ",7,
Page,256,27,"Hiya. How&#039;re you doing? ",29,1
Andrew,268,12,"I&#039;m doing alright. How about you? ",39,1
Page,328,60,"I&#039;m doing alright myself. ",31,1
Andrew,345,17,"What are you up to? Nice. ",26,1
Page,373,28,"I j ust woke up, going to make breakfast soon.",46,1
Andrew,416,43,"What will you get? ",19,1
Page,489,73,"I&#039;ll probably have cereal, or something easy. ",51,1
Andrew,546,57,"It&#039;s past midday for me, what time is it for you? ",55,1
Page,570,24,"It&#039;s just past noon here. ",31,1
Andrew,602,32,"You didn&#039;t wake up too early I see! ",41,1
Page,650,48,"Nah, I stayed up way too late last night. ",42,1
Andrew,664,14,"Busy night? ",12,1
Page,715,51,"Mostly just gaming, watching stuff on Youtube. ",47,1
Andrew,744,29,"What kind of things do you watch? Oh alright. ",46,1
Page,794,50,"I can&#039;t remember what I watched last night, actually. I fell asleep pretty quickly after I got in bed. ",108,1
Andrew,851,57,"Lately I&#039;ve been watching a lot of show reactions. ",56,1
Page,882,31,"Oh? That sounds like fun. ",26,1
Andrew,907,25,"It&#039;s interesting to see people react the same way you did when you watched the show yourself, yeah. ",105,1
Page,970,63,"I could imagine. I don&#039;t watch a lot of TV shows myself., so it&#039;s hard to compare. ",93,1
Andrew,1004,34,"what about the games? Oh yeah. ",31,1
Page,1085,81,"Lately I&#039;ve been playing the same games a lot, or playing with friends. Hard to compare thoughts and feelings on them the same as TV though. ",146,1
Andrew,1133,48,"Yeah I can imagine. Which games do you play? ",45,1
Page,1160,27,"Lately I&#039;ve been playing a lot of Rainbow Six Siege, and the new Fire Emblem. ",83,1
Moderator,1168,8,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1183,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Page,1214,31,"I&#039;m not entirely sure, I suspect the AI, since the way it&#039;s handled compound sentences,  but I&#039;ll have to see the other for comparison.",150,
Moderator,1260,46,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",144,
Page,1273,13,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,1279,6,"Hello! ",7,
Page,1287,8,"Hiya, how are you doing? ",25,2
Andrew,1296,9,"I&#039;m doing alright! What about you? ",40,2
Page,1324,28,"I&#039;m a little bit tired, but doing well. ",45,2
Andrew,1337,13,"Is it late for you? ",20,2
Page,1360,23,"Nah, it&#039;s just past noon. I slept late  today.",51,2
Andrew,1401,41,"Oh alright. Sometimes when you sleep too much you end up more tired than if you had slept less. ",96,2
Page,1453,52,"I think it&#039;s mostly a side effect of medication, actually. I get really sleepy if I don&#039;t go to bed early enough. ",124,2
Andrew,1511,58,"Oh I see yeah. Drugs can really mess up your sleeping schedule. ",64,2
Page,1567,56,"Oddly they managed to regulate my sleep schedule so I go to bed at a more reasonable hour. But if I try to slip into the way I used to sleep, staying up until 5AM, I&#039;m pretty much dead the next day. ",204,2
Andrew,1628,61,"Staying up until 5AM can&#039;t really be healthy though if you do it all the time, so that actually sounds like a good thing! ",127,2
Page,1646,18,"I think so, yes. Just takes some getting used to. ",50,2
Andrew,1670,24,"How long have you been using them? ",35,2
Page,1680,10,"For a month, now. ",18,2
Andrew,1736,56,"Right, I can see why it&#039;s much harder to stay up late now. Hopefully you found something to do during the day. ",116,2
Page,1776,40,"Well, lots of coffee, playing games, trying to get back into writing lately. I&#039;m still bored a lot, but at least I sleep well. ",132,2
Andrew,1832,56,"Well that&#039;s a start. So you&#039;re a writer, or do you just do it for fun? ",81,2
Page,1854,22,"Just for fun, I don&#039;t think I could ever finish writing a novel or anything like that. ",92,2
Andrew,1888,34,"It&#039;s a very big commitment yes, and takes a very long time. ",65,2
Page,1931,43,"I don&#039;t think I could stick to one idea nearly long enough, yeah. Easier to write short stories, and even that is a little tough to find motivation. ",154,2
Andrew,1978,47,"Yeah. I heard it&#039;s easier if you find a way to isolate yourself from any distraction, to stay within your own bubble. ",123,2
Page,1994,16,"Unfortunately that tends to be impossible, too much noise around here. ",71,2
Andrew,2018,24,"You live with someone? ",23,2
Page,2047,29,"I live with family, and they&#039;re noisy. ",44,2
Andrew,2094,47,"Oh yeah. I can understand that it would be hard to focus then. ",63,2
Page,2132,38,"Have you ever tried writing anything yourself? ",47,2
Andrew,2155,23,"Yeah. I failed miserably to be honest. ",39,2
Page,2173,18,"I bet you could be good at it if you kept trying. ",50,2
Andrew,2191,18,"That&#039;s can be applied to anything though. ",47,2
Moderator,2203,12,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2227,24,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Page,2241,14,"I&#039;ll take a moment to scroll back through and see if I can compare them. ",78,
Moderator,2256,15,"Alright ",8,
Page,2268,12,"I think the first one was the AI, still. ",41,
Moderator,2279,11,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Page,2306,27,"Slightly more than 50/50, I&#039;d  say a 5.",44,
Moderator,2314,8,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2322,8,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. ",107,
Page,2323,1,"Cool, thanks! ",14,
