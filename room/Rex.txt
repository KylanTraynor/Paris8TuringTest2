<span id="time-span">01:16:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Rex. 
<span id="time-span">01:17:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:17:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you can see this, please say &quot;yes&quot; 
<span id="time-span">01:17:44</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">01:17:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">01:17:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">01:18:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:18:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">01:18:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">01:18:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">01:18:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">01:18:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">01:19:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">01:19:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">01:19:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">01:19:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">01:19:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">01:19:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">01:19:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:19:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">01:20:09</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">01:20:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">01:20:29</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">01:20:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:20:55</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Hi there 
<span id="time-span">01:21:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">01:21:23</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I&#039;m doing well. How are you? 
<span id="time-span">01:21:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">01:22:18</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Not much. Just enjoying a quiet Saturday 
<span id="time-span">01:22:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds quite good. That&#039;s pretty much the same for me actually. 
<span id="time-span">01:23:49</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>It&#039;s nice to enjoy some peace and quiet every now and then, isn&#039;t it? 
<span id="time-span">01:24:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. Without the stress of having to work on something or running everywhere. Simply enjoying yourself watching TV or playing games. 
<span id="time-span">01:25:14</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Indeed. It&#039;s my favorite way to spend my time off 
<span id="time-span">01:25:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you like video games? 
<span id="time-span">01:26:32</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I do, actually. They&#039;re my favorite pastime 
<span id="time-span">01:26:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Which ones in particular? Or what kind of games? 
<span id="time-span">01:27:37</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I enjoy most genres. I&#039;ve recently started playing Halo again 
<span id="time-span">01:28:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah I played the first three ones a while ago in co-op. 
<span id="time-span">01:28:50</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>That&#039;s cool. Which one is your favorite? 
<span id="time-span">01:29:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not entirely sure. I&#039;d say the third one, but I never got to finish it. 
<span id="time-span">01:30:08</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Have you played any of the newer ones? 
<span id="time-span">01:30:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Unfortunately no. I don&#039;t have a Xbox One. 
<span id="time-span">01:31:13</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Neither do I 
<span id="time-span">01:31:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve watched a playthrough of the fourth on youtube though. 
<span id="time-span">01:32:59</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I didn&#039;t enjoy the fourth one very much. I haven&#039;t played the fifth, so I wouldn&#039;t know much about it 
<span id="time-span">01:33:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What is it you didn&#039;t like in the fourth? 
<span id="time-span">01:34:33</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>The plot seemed pointless and the gameplay felt too generic. Overall just not very memorable 
<span id="time-span">01:36:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">01:36:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">01:36:31</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>The A.I. 
<span id="time-span">01:36:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">01:36:50</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">01:36:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:37:18</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Hello there 
<span id="time-span">01:37:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">01:37:50</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I&#039;m doing well, and you? 
<span id="time-span">01:38:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">01:38:30</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Just sitting around, enjoying my afternoon 
<span id="time-span">01:39:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Anything fun planned? 
<span id="time-span">01:39:36</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Other than sleeping in, not really 
<span id="time-span">01:40:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, that&#039;s not bad. I could definitely use that. 
<span id="time-span">01:40:49</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I&#039;m sure. Are you up to anything interesting? 
<span id="time-span">01:41:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Probably just going to play games actually. Do you play Minecraft? 
<span id="time-span">01:41:46</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I used to, but not so much anymore 
<span id="time-span">01:42:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Why not? 
<span id="time-span">01:42:44</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I felt that it got repetitive quickly. Ran out of things to do 
<span id="time-span">01:43:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ah yeah that tends to happen unfortunately. 
<span id="time-span">01:43:38</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Are there any other games you enjoy? 
<span id="time-span">01:44:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I only really play Minecraft, but lately I&#039;ve also been very much into Mass Effect. 
<span id="time-span">01:44:52</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Have you played the newest one? 
<span id="time-span">01:45:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I have actually. 
<span id="time-span">01:45:48</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Did you enjoy it? I&#039;ve heard good and bad things about it 
<span id="time-span">01:46:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I did yes. But it still deserves its reputation. It does have good and bad things. 
<span id="time-span">01:47:00</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>What did you enjoy most about it? 
<span id="time-span">01:47:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s a good question actually. I&#039;m not entirely sure. 
<span id="time-span">01:48:11</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>What system do you play it on? 
<span id="time-span">01:48:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>PC. That&#039;s where I play most of my games now. 
<span id="time-span">01:49:29</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>I&#039;ve been wanting to get a new PC, but I don&#039;t quite have the funds at the moment 
<span id="time-span">01:50:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah they can be quite expensive. I think it&#039;s a really good idea if you want to enjoy plenty of nice games though. You don&#039;t need to get one that expensive to play the latest games on it. 
<span id="time-span">01:52:03</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Yeah, but I&#039;d like one that can handle pretty much any game and still have them look great. Also, one that will last a while 
<span id="time-span">01:52:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Get a desktop computer then. 
<span id="time-span">01:52:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">01:52:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">01:53:14</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>Human 
<span id="time-span">01:53:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">01:53:29</span><span id="name-span">Rex</span>3 
<span id="time-span">01:53:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.
