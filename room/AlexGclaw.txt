<span id="time-span">23:30:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello AlexGelaw 
<span id="time-span">23:31:03</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">23:31:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:15</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Its my pleasure 
<span id="time-span">23:31:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:31</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:31:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:39</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:31:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:50</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:31:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:20</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>undertood 
<span id="time-span">23:32:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:50</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:32:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">23:33:00</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:33:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">23:33:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:33:09</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:33:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:33:19</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:33:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:33:24</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">23:33:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:33:49</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">23:33:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:34:02</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">23:34:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:34:16</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>IM fine and you?

<span id="time-span">23:34:54</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Im just spending a lazy sunday  
<span id="time-span">23:35:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Isn&#039;t it Friday? 
<span id="time-span">23:35:49</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Yeah but i had no work today   
<span id="time-span">23:36:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What did you do then? Oh I see. 
<span id="time-span">23:36:41</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Mostly breakfast and reading some books 
<span id="time-span">23:37:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds nice. What kind of books do you like? 
<span id="time-span">23:37:28</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Travel diaries  
<span id="time-span">23:38:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m more into fantasy or sci-fi books. I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever read one of those. 
<span id="time-span">23:38:25</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Theyre really nice if they talk about a place you know really well  
<span id="time-span">23:39:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Wouldn&#039;t it be more interesting to read things about places where you&#039;ve never been before? 
<span id="time-span">23:40:26</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Well I like to, but since i like history a lot and understanding how things came to be, the acounts of travlers are always great to me. I also read for other parts but i focus mostly on ones from my c
<span id="time-span">23:41:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>So it&#039;s really to get more information about place you can actually relate to. Oh right I see. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:13</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Yes, you have any favourite read? 
<span id="time-span">23:42:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I mostly play video games. Unfortunately I haven&#039;t been reading much in a while. 
<span id="time-span">23:43:34</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>I see, still fun, I used to play much, but I stopped sinc my ps3 broke 
<span id="time-span">23:43:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Which games did you like to play? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:39</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>I was a huge FIFA fan but i also like some shooters like halo or BF3 and my all time favourite is of course Zelda 
<span id="time-span">23:45:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Especially Minecraft. I mostly play RPGs and sandbox games. 
<span id="time-span">23:45:54</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>nice, minecraft can be so adictive 
<span id="time-span">23:46:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I play way too much of it. It really can yeah. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:27</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>You start playing and you suddenly realize hours passed. Its a great way to get distracted in a heatly way 
<span id="time-span">23:48:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Did you play it much? I can spend my nights on it, yeah. 
<span id="time-span">23:49:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:49:13</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:49:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">23:49:23</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>human 
<span id="time-span">23:49:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:49:40</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">23:49:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:50:14</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Hello Andrew 
<span id="time-span">23:50:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:50:28</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Im doing great and you? 
<span id="time-span">23:50:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:50:55</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>So far just laying in bed in a lazy day 
<span id="time-span">23:51:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds very much like me actually! I&#039;ve been mostly watching youtube videos and playing games. 
<span id="time-span">23:52:10</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Good, thats how it should be right ? 
<span id="time-span">23:52:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I wish it could be like that everyday. But I guess it will have to stop eventually. 
<span id="time-span">23:53:27</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>yeah, not healthy and it can become repetitive after a while, I like to go out too and explore the city 
<span id="time-span">23:54:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It really depends on what you do with your time lazing around. If you use that time to learn it can be healthy, but better do something else from time to time yes! 
<span id="time-span">23:55:39</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>I usually watch talk shows and the news and play online games, its gets old aftr a while 
<span id="time-span">23:56:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I can imagine. I tend to watch science videos or things like that, but it can get quite boring too. Do you play online with friends? 
<span id="time-span">23:57:34</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>I used to but not anymore. I do travel a lot tough whith them when i can 
<span id="time-span">23:58:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s quite cool. I haven&#039;t really met most of my online friends so far. 
<span id="time-span">23:58:46</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Why not? 
<span id="time-span">23:59:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>They tend to live in the US, and I&#039;m Canadian. I can&#039;t really easily travel at the moment. 
<span id="time-span">00:01:16</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Oh I see, I cant endure the cold myself hehe, canada seems too cold for me 
<span id="time-span">00:01:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It can definitely be cold during winter... which tends to last almost 6 months here! But the rest of the year it&#039;s quite reasonable. 
<span id="time-span">00:03:04</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>I see. I have a brother over there and he really has gone crazy with it haha, but good crazy 
<span id="time-span">00:03:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you mind if I ask where you live? 
<span id="time-span">00:03:51</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Im from Mexico 
<span id="time-span">00:04:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah, that&#039;s really not the same climate as Canada, that&#039;s for sure! 
<span id="time-span">00:04:41</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Nope 
<span id="time-span">00:05:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never been to Mexico. Well, I&#039;ve never actually went out of Canada, so... 
<span id="time-span">00:05:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">00:05:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">00:05:39</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>Human 
<span id="time-span">00:06:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">00:06:13</span><span id="name-span">AlexGclaw</span>6
