Moderator,0,0,"Hello 56k. ",11,
Moderator,11,11,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,25,14,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
56k,39,14,"I am. ",6,
Moderator,60,21,"Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",110,
Moderator,66,6,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
56k,71,5,"Go for it. ",11,
Moderator,73,2,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,81,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,88,7,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,95,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,102,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,109,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,116,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,122,6,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,131,9,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,139,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,149,10,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,159,10,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,167,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,175,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
56k,235,60,"I do. One question: should I pose my questions/statements/posts in an attempt to actively fool the AI in order to obtain a correct answer (while still maintaining normal English), or: ",184,
56k,243,8,"Have conversation flow be as natural as possible? ",50,
Moderator,265,22,"It&#039;s up to you, as long as you talk to the character, and not the actors. ",79,
56k,276,11,"Got it. ",8,
Moderator,284,8,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
56k,307,23,"I am! ",6,
Andrew,311,4,"Hello! ",7,
56k,333,22,"Hi, Andrew! What a fantastic name. Could you tell me the origin of it? ",71,1
Andrew,371,38,"I actually never thought about it. Well, my parents? ",53,1
56k,390,19,"What were your parents names? ",30,1
Andrew,409,19,"Kyle and Olivia. ",17,1
56k,422,13,"What&#039;s the first memory you have of your mother? ",54,1
Andrew,464,42,"That&#039;s a good question, I&#039;m not entirely sure actually. ",66,1
56k,483,19,"Makes sense! What town did you grow up in? ",43,1
Andrew,521,38,"Ontario, London. That&#039;s also where I&#039;m studying right now. ",69,1
56k,571,50,"Oh neat, so you&#039;ve been there a while. How old are you, Andrew? ",69,1
Andrew,584,13,"I&#039;m 21. What about you? ",29,1
56k,599,15,"30, I&#039;m old. Do you think that 30 is old or that 40 is the new 20? ",72,1
Andrew,689,90,"Depends on the person. Well, 30 is not that old. Some are still young at 40 and others are already old at 20. ",110,1
56k,740,51,"Do you go to bars, Andrew? If so, what is your favorite drink? If you don&#039;t, what is your favorite sandwich? ",114,1
Andrew,789,49,"Pizzasub. No, I don&#039;t really go to bars. ",46,1
56k,894,105,"Great. Would you rather have a pizzasub with grenadine or a glass of hamburger with cocoa? ",91,1
Andrew,972,78,"A pizzasub with grenadine sounds less impossible than the other one, but neither option sound really appealing. ",112,1
56k,993,21,"Yeah, I agree. By the way, I forget. How old will you be in 5 years? ",69,1
Andrew,1019,26,"If I&#039;m not dead before, 26. ",33,1
56k,1049,30,"I understand that! Do you prefer blondes or brunettes? ",55,1
Andrew,1093,44,"So brunettes. My girlfriend is a brunette. ",43,1
56k,1139,46,"I hear that. Does your redheaded girlfriend also like pizzasubs? ",65,1
Andrew,1189,50,"She&#039;s not redheaded, I only have one girlfriend. She does though. ",71,1
56k,1210,21,"Great! I have one more question after this but first, do you want to ask me anything? ",86,1
Andrew,1239,29,"Go ahead, not really no. ",25,1
56k,1247,8,"When is your birthday? ",23,1
Moderator,1249,2,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1271,22,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
56k,1343,72,"If I can reserve that guess for after the second conversation I would; this actor responded sensibly to nonsensical questions and corrected me in a natural manner, but also incorrectly placed some -&gt; ",203,
56k,1380,37,"sentences and responded to questions I didn&#039;t ask. Still, I&#039;d lean 70% chance human and 30% chance  AI.",113,
Moderator,1421,41,"So, I&#039;ll take it your first answer is Human. You&#039;ll be able to change it after the second conversation. ",114,
56k,1427,6,"Yep! ",5,
Moderator,1443,16,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
56k,1447,4,"I am. ",6,
Andrew,1460,13,"Hello! ",7,
56k,1475,15,"Hi Andrew! What a wonderful name. Where is your family from? ",61,2
Andrew,1516,41,"My father&#039;s side is from Ireland, and my mother&#039;s from France. ",73,2
56k,1550,34,"Where is your family currently located? ",40,2
Andrew,1564,14,"We live in London, Ontario. ",28,2
56k,1581,17,"I see! What generation of your mother&#039;s side first came to Ontario? ",73,2
Andrew,1629,48,"Her grand parents I think. ",27,2
56k,1653,24,"Would that be your great grandparents? ",39,2
Andrew,1667,14,"By definition yes. ",19,2
56k,1684,17,"Andrew, what is your favorite restaurant in London? ",52,2
Andrew,1739,55,"I haven&#039;t really been in many restaurants, there is one next to the fields that I like but I can&#039;t remember its name. There&#039;s a minigolf right next to it though. ",177,2
56k,1751,12,"What kind of food does it serve? ",33,2
Andrew,1778,27,"Many different things. I usually just take a burger or ribs though. ",68,2
56k,1827,49,"Great! If you like a fried egg on your burger, don&#039;t tell me what your favorite color is and tell me what your lucky number is. ",133,2
Andrew,1860,33,"6. ",3,2
56k,1878,18,"A good, solid number! Are you  married, or do you have a girlfriend? ",69,2
Andrew,1902,24,"I have a girlfriend yes. Gosh you type fast. ",45,2
56k,1909,7,"I&#039;m quick on the draw! ",28,2
Andrew,1914,5,"Right. ",7,2
56k,1939,25,"Have you told your girlfriend about your affair with your girlfriend? ",70,2
Andrew,1948,9,"She knows about it. ",20,2
56k,2002,54,"Do you prefer it when the sun is blue or when the sky is boxed? ",64,2
Andrew,2043,41,"Well I do like blue stars. But I don&#039;t think I can answer that question. ",78,2
56k,2072,29,"[stop] ",7,2
Moderator,2084,12,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,2103,19,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
56k,2147,44,"Do you want just the answer or my thoughts? ",44,
Moderator,2160,13,"First just the answer. ",23,
56k,2164,4,"I don&#039;t want to step out of bounds. <img src='smiles/smile.gif'/>  ",72,
56k,2173,9,"I&#039;m going to keep banking on human. ",41,
Moderator,2179,6,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
56k,2184,5,"Hahahahhah ",11,
Moderator,2233,49,"? ",2,
56k,2238,5,"Sorry, I&#039;m thinking ",25,
56k,2244,6,"I&#039;m going to go with 2 or 3 ",33,
56k,2247,3,"So 2 ",5,
56k,2253,6,"I&#039;m impressed either way ",30,
Moderator,2272,19,"Alright, now you can go with your thoughts ",43,
56k,2341,69,"Well first, I&#039;m not convinced you don&#039;t have two humans! The second conversation tripped on the burger answer (I figure an AI would do neither, but a human could misread it) but : ",190,
56k,2357,16,"also tripped on the girlfriend answer (not &quot;How can I have an affair with the same person? or &quot;I&#039;m not having an affair.&quot;). ",144,
56k,2392,35,"Given I&#039;m not an expert with AI but that&#039;s how I figure it would go, knowing more about human communication (it&#039;s my field) than AI ",147,
56k,2437,45,"Still, the first one dealt better with non-sequitur and nonsensical questions, thus my answer, but I have a distinct gut feeling I&#039;m wrong ",144,
56k,2441,4,"That concludes my thoughts ",27,
56k,2461,20,"Do I get to know if I was correct? ",35,
Moderator,2462,1,"What was that burger answer thing in the 2nd conversation? ",59,
Moderator,2503,41,"oh, with the fried egg. ",24,
Moderator,2544,41,"Alright, so I&#039;ll tell you the answer, give me a second ",60,
56k,2573,29,"Sure thing. Given, I&#039;m not an expert on AI or fooling them or particularly think I&#039;m clever! ;) ",106,
Moderator,2591,18,"The first conversation was with the machine! ",45,
56k,2596,5,"Haha, I&#039;ll be damn. ",25,
56k,2602,6,"That&#039;s very convincing. ",29,
Moderator,2630,28,"I&#039;m curious though, what was wrong with the burger and the girlfriend in your opinion? ",92,
Moderator,2643,13,"(this is not a part of the experiment, I&#039;m just curious) ",62,
56k,2713,70,"Absolutely. Well, prefacing this again with &quot;I am not a smart man&quot;, my attempt was to get a non-fried egg loving AI to say &quot;I don&#039;t like fried egg, so I shouldn&#039;t tell him what my favorite color OR ",223,
56k,2732,19,"my lucky number.&quot; ",23,
56k,2779,47,"With the girlfriend, &quot;Is your girlfriend aware of the affair you&#039;re having with your girlfriend&quot; is entrapping and also nonsensical--&quot;Yes&quot; implies you&#039;re having an affair and she knows, &quot;No&quot; implies ",239,
Moderator,2839,60,"For the burger you said &quot;if you like a fried egg on your burger, don&#039;t tell me your favorite color and tell me your lucky number.&quot; So what I assume happened was that he considered he liked a fried egg",215,
56k,2840,1,"you&#039;re having an affair and she doesn&#039;t know--but you can&#039;t have an affair with your own girlfriend, on your own girlfriend (I didn&#039;t specify other girlfriend), either way. ",193,
56k,2866,26,"So, I figured that a human would either respond with a confused answer or deny the affair (thus falling for the joke). ",119,
56k,2888,22,"The response was   which pretty much sealed the deal for me, in my mind",71,
56k,2920,32,"That&#039;s no problem; it definitely wasn&#039;t a sure thing on the hamburger; that&#039;s just my thought process on it. ",124,
Moderator,2958,38,"And for the girlfriend part, I got the confirmation that he just answered with humor, saying that if he was having an affair with his own girlfriend, then she&#039;d know about it. ",181,
56k,2981,23,"(And he should, because only a filthy robot-loving AI wouldn&#039;t like fried egg--if he liked fried egg as an AI, my thought process was that he wouldn&#039;t answer at all or dodge the question) ",198,
Moderator,3005,24,"Oh ok ^^ ",9,
Moderator,3033,28,"Well anyways, thanks a lot for your help ^^ ",44,
56k,3040,7,"Totally! It just tripped my sensors. Either way, very impressive and you&#039;re very welcome. <img src='smiles/smile.gif'/> ",125,
56k,3042,2,"Good luck with the study! ",26,
Moderator,3060,18,"Thanks! You can now close this window. ",39,
