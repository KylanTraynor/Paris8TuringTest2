<span id="time-span">17:58:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome QTLari. 
<span id="time-span">17:58:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:58:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please say yes if you can see this. 
<span id="time-span">17:59:15</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Yes! 
<span id="time-span">17:59:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Perfect. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">17:59:33</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>OK! 
<span id="time-span">17:59:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">17:59:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:59:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">17:59:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">18:01:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">18:01:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">18:01:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post at a time. 
<span id="time-span">18:01:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">18:01:33</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>I understand the rules and what I need to do! 
<span id="time-span">18:01:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">18:02:04</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>I am ready! 
<span id="time-span">18:02:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">18:02:16</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Hello, Andrew! How are you today? 
<span id="time-span">18:02:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright thanks! How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">18:02:36</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Not too bad, I&#039;m enjoying a day off! 
<span id="time-span">18:02:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh nice! Time to relax then! 
<span id="time-span">18:03:18</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Yeah! It&#039;s been fairly quiet but I&#039;ve been super busy lately! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">18:03:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much honestly. Probably just going to be playing Minecraft later. 
<span id="time-span">18:04:02</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Haha, I&#039;ve never played Minecraft! I only play simple things like the Sims! 
<span id="time-span">18:04:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I used to play the Sims too. Which one do you play? 
<span id="time-span">18:04:45</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Mostly 3, although I used to play 2 a little! The city feature&#039;s really neat in 3! 
<span id="time-span">18:05:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah it really is nice to see your characters travel around. I was sad when they removed it in the 4th. 
<span id="time-span">18:05:52</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>I heard about that! They also got rid of a lot of core features! You would expect a new game to be more complex! 
<span id="time-span">18:06:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>To be fair there was a lot of new things. But despite all of them the game felt so much more limited. The size of the plots and all of that didn&#039;t help. 
<span id="time-span">18:06:59</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>I think this actor is the human! 
<span id="time-span">18:07:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupte! 
<span id="time-span">18:07:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">18:07:32</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>I think I have been talking to the human! 
<span id="time-span">18:08:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright! We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">18:08:09</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Yes, I&#039;m ready! 
<span id="time-span">18:08:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">18:08:22</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Hello there, Andrew! How are you? 
<span id="time-span">18:08:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! You? 
<span id="time-span">18:08:43</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Not too bad! I&#039;ve been enjoying my day off! I haven&#039;t been very productive! 
<span id="time-span">18:08:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ah yeah, I can&#039;t say I have been either. 
<span id="time-span">18:09:18</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Oh? What have you been doing? I&#039;ve just been browsing the internet! 
<span id="time-span">18:09:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly just playing Minecraft. 
<span id="time-span">18:09:51</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Oh? I&#039;ve never played Minecraft! It&#039;s a bit too complicated for me! 
<span id="time-span">18:10:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Really? It&#039;s just a sandbox game. 
<span id="time-span">18:10:33</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Well, there&#039;s so much to do! I wouldn&#039;t know where to start! I prefer stuff like the Sims! 
<span id="time-span">18:10:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I played the Sims too actually! 
<span id="time-span">18:11:11</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Oh! That&#039;s cool! I think 3 is my favourite, how about you? 
<span id="time-span">18:11:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The 3rd one definitely is mine as well! 
<span id="time-span">18:11:57</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>Oh cool! I like how much they added from 2! Like the city feature! 
<span id="time-span">18:12:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It was so cool to be able to see your sims walk around, yeah. 
<span id="time-span">18:12:50</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>I think this actor is the AI! 
<span id="time-span">18:12:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">18:13:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  (Standardized questions sorry )
<span id="time-span">18:13:33</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>In the first conversation, I think the actor was human! 
<span id="time-span">18:13:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">18:13:51</span><span id="name-span">QTLari</span>5! 
<span id="time-span">18:14:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.
