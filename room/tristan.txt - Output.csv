tristan,0,0,"hello ",6,
Moderator,9,9,"Welcome tristan. ",17,
Moderator,19,10,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
tristan,22,3,"Yay. ",5,
Moderator,26,4,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
tristan,30,4,"Ok ",3,
Moderator,32,2,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,39,7,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,46,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,59,13,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,66,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,72,6,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,77,5,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
tristan,82,5,"Mmmmkay ",8,
Moderator,85,3,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,92,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,98,6,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,112,14,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying STOP. ",92,
Moderator,118,6,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,125,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,130,5,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,136,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
tristan,146,10,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,189,43,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
tristan,235,46,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,239,4,"Hello! ",7,
tristan,275,36,"Greetings. How&#039;s it going? ",32,1
Andrew,299,24,"What are you up to? I&#039;m doing quite alright! ",50,1
tristan,330,31,"I&#039;ve just been chatting this past hour. Mostly with humans, I think. ",74,1
Andrew,365,35,"Sounds nice. Is that why you wanted to chat with an AI for a change? ",69,1
tristan,399,34,"Yes!  I find AI fascinating on a number of levels.",50,1
Andrew,430,31,"They are quite interesting yes. What do you like about them in particular? ",75,1
tristan,487,57,"W can larn about toe human mind as we design A.I. ",50,1
Andrew,524,37,"Especially about how we learn and things like that. That&#039;s quite true yes. ",80,1
tristan,572,48,"Why are you here? ",18,1
Andrew,620,48,"To talk to you actually. Friends are making this study. ",56,1
tristan,687,67,"That is nice of you. Hopefully some good karma will go your way because  of it. ",80,1
Andrew,710,23,"I could need it right now. I do hope so! ",41,1
tristan,756,46,"What do you need help with lately? ",35,1
Andrew,782,26,"Well it&#039;s mostly because of all the stress with the coming exams. ",71,1
tristan,820,38,"Well if it makes you feel any better, nobody will care about your grades in a couple short years! ",98,1
Andrew,853,33,"That is quite true! Are you a student? ",39,1
tristan,895,42,"Nah I graduated back in 2012. Studied neuroscience but got into programming. ",77,1
Andrew,935,40,"Oh that is quite cool! What do you do? ",39,1
tristan,1072,137,"I did program for a couple years but I found that it wasn&#039;t really helping anyone so I got into activism full time ",120,1
Andrew,1128,56,"What kind of activism? I think programming can help a lot of people actually. ",78,1
tristan,1173,45,"Oh yes I agree but the non profit where I was working was corrupted by gov and corporate money ",95,1
Moderator,1186,13,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1209,23,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
tristan,1299,90,"Human ",6,
Moderator,1330,31,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
tristan,1340,10,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1347,7,"Hello! ",7,
tristan,1453,106,"Greetings ",10,2
Andrew,1467,14,"How are you doing? ",19,2
tristan,1486,19,"Oh I am doing pretty well. How are you? ",40,2
Andrew,1513,27,"I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What are you up to? ",57,2
tristan,1549,36,"Chatting and looking at buying a new laptop! ",45,2
Andrew,1577,28,"Oh damn that&#039;s cool! Is it for gaming or for work? ",56,2
tristan,1625,48,"Both hahaha. I don&#039;t game as much as I use to but it&#039;s still nice to be able to when necessary. Do you game? ",119,2
Andrew,1664,39,"I do quite a lot actually! I mostly play Minecraft, but lately I&#039;ve also been quite into Mass Effect. ",107,2
tristan,1718,54,"Ahhh yeah Minecraft is great. I use to play a similar mod that turned my favorite game Tribes 2 into a construction playland.  ",127,2
Andrew,1769,51,"I&#039;ve never played Tribes, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard about it. What is it about (without mods that is) ",116,2
tristan,1846,77,"Sci fi shooter with sometimes very large teams... lots of complexity and vehicles and jet packs and frictionless shoes so you can ski up to 300 km/h! ",150,2
Andrew,1902,56,"Damn that does sound like a lot of fun. With a mod to turn it into a more Minecraft-like game it sounds even better. I should probably try that. ",145,2
tristan,2010,108,"Ahhh it&#039;s not around anymore. The company who owned it eventually shut the servers down. Real tragedy haha ",112,2
Andrew,2037,27,"And there&#039;s nothing like private servers or something? ",60,2
tristan,2144,107,"Good question. Some people did put up a private server - called it Tribes Next. But the new Tribes game sort of killed what few servers remained. ",146,2
Andrew,2184,40,"Oh I see. That is quite a shame. Did you find any other game to replace it? ",76,2
tristan,2273,89,"the new one, Tribes Ascend, is pretty solid but is also dying. I know that the next Unreal Tournament will have a great mod community because they are keeping it very open source. ",180,2
Moderator,2308,35,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2320,12,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the FIRST conversation?  ",81,
tristan,2356,36,"computer ",9,
Moderator,2361,5,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
tristan,2398,37,"2 ",2,
Moderator,2404,6,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,
Moderator,2423,19,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window. ",116,
