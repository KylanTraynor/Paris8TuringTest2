<span id="time-span">20:35:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome tristan. 
<span id="time-span">20:35:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:35:36</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Yay. 
<span id="time-span">20:35:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">20:35:44</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Ok 
<span id="time-span">20:35:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">20:35:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:36</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Mmmmkay 
<span id="time-span">20:36:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">20:37:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying STOP. 
<span id="time-span">20:37:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">20:37:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">20:37:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">20:37:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">20:37:40</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">20:38:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">20:39:09</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">20:39:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">20:39:49</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Greetings. How&#039;s it going? 
<span id="time-span">20:40:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What are you up to? I&#039;m doing quite alright! 
<span id="time-span">20:40:44</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>I&#039;ve just been chatting this past hour. Mostly with humans, I think. 
<span id="time-span">20:41:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds nice. Is that why you wanted to chat with an AI for a change? 
<span id="time-span">20:41:53</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Yes!  I find AI fascinating on a number of levels.
<span id="time-span">20:42:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>They are quite interesting yes. What do you like about them in particular? 
<span id="time-span">20:43:21</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>W can larn about toe human mind as we design A.I. 
<span id="time-span">20:43:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Especially about how we learn and things like that. That&#039;s quite true yes. 
<span id="time-span">20:44:46</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Why are you here? 
<span id="time-span">20:45:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>To talk to you actually. Friends are making this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:46:41</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>That is nice of you. Hopefully some good karma will go your way because  of it. 
<span id="time-span">20:47:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I could need it right now. I do hope so! 
<span id="time-span">20:47:50</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>What do you need help with lately? 
<span id="time-span">20:48:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well it&#039;s mostly because of all the stress with the coming exams. 
<span id="time-span">20:48:54</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Well if it makes you feel any better, nobody will care about your grades in a couple short years! 
<span id="time-span">20:49:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That is quite true! Are you a student? 
<span id="time-span">20:50:09</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Nah I graduated back in 2012. Studied neuroscience but got into programming. 
<span id="time-span">20:50:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh that is quite cool! What do you do? 
<span id="time-span">20:53:06</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>I did program for a couple years but I found that it wasn&#039;t really helping anyone so I got into activism full time 
<span id="time-span">20:54:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of activism? I think programming can help a lot of people actually. 
<span id="time-span">20:54:47</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Oh yes I agree but the non profit where I was working was corrupted by gov and corporate money 
<span id="time-span">20:55:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">20:55:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">20:56:53</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Human 
<span id="time-span">20:57:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">20:57:34</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">20:57:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">20:59:27</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Greetings 
<span id="time-span">20:59:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">21:00:00</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Oh I am doing pretty well. How are you? 
<span id="time-span">21:00:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">21:01:03</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Chatting and looking at buying a new laptop! 
<span id="time-span">21:01:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh damn that&#039;s cool! Is it for gaming or for work? 
<span id="time-span">21:02:19</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Both hahaha. I don&#039;t game as much as I use to but it&#039;s still nice to be able to when necessary. Do you game? 
<span id="time-span">21:02:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I do quite a lot actually! I mostly play Minecraft, but lately I&#039;ve also been quite into Mass Effect. 
<span id="time-span">21:03:52</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Ahhh yeah Minecraft is great. I use to play a similar mod that turned my favorite game Tribes 2 into a construction playland.  
<span id="time-span">21:04:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never played Tribes, I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard about it. What is it about (without mods that is) 
<span id="time-span">21:06:00</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Sci fi shooter with sometimes very large teams... lots of complexity and vehicles and jet packs and frictionless shoes so you can ski up to 300 km/h! 
<span id="time-span">21:06:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Damn that does sound like a lot of fun. With a mod to turn it into a more Minecraft-like game it sounds even better. I should probably try that. 
<span id="time-span">21:08:44</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Ahhh it&#039;s not around anymore. The company who owned it eventually shut the servers down. Real tragedy haha 
<span id="time-span">21:09:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>And there&#039;s nothing like private servers or something? 
<span id="time-span">21:10:58</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>Good question. Some people did put up a private server - called it Tribes Next. But the new Tribes game sort of killed what few servers remained. 
<span id="time-span">21:11:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. That is quite a shame. Did you find any other game to replace it? 
<span id="time-span">21:13:07</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>the new one, Tribes Ascend, is pretty solid but is also dying. I know that the next Unreal Tournament will have a great mod community because they are keeping it very open source. 
<span id="time-span">21:13:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">21:13:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the FIRST conversation?  
<span id="time-span">21:14:30</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>computer 
<span id="time-span">21:14:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">21:15:12</span><span id="name-span">tristan</span>2 
<span id="time-span">21:15:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">21:15:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window.
