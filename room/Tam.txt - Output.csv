Moderator,0,0,"Welcome Tam. ",13,
Moderator,7,7,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Tam,23,16,"No problem, got some time to kill. ",35,
Moderator,33,10,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,39,6,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,59,20,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,66,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,76,10,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,86,10,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,93,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,100,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,111,11,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,119,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,127,8,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,138,11,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,147,9,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,155,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,164,9,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,172,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Tam,190,18,"I do. Any other kinds of posts that are to be avoided? ",55,
Moderator,214,24,"Not necessarily. But try to keep talking to Andrew, not the actors. ",68,
Moderator,269,55,"Any other questions? ",21,
Tam,289,20,"Don&#039;t think so. ",21,
Moderator,297,8,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Tam,306,9,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,312,6,"Hello! ",7,
Tam,322,10,"Hello, Andrew! How has your day been? ",38,1
Andrew,339,17,"It&#039;s been quite alright thanks! What about your day? ",58,1
Tam,362,23,"It was okay, first week of Uni is always a bit boring. Are you a student too, or what do you do? ",97,1
Andrew,417,55,"I study Biology yes. Why is this your first week though? Isn&#039;t it halfway through the year already? ",105,1
Tam,447,30,"Not where I live. The semester just started this Monday - or rather this Tuesday, since the Monday was a holiday. ",114,1
Andrew,478,31,"Oh alright. Where do you live? If you don&#039;t mind me asking. ",65,1
Tam,505,27,"Germany, that is as specific as I am going to get. You&#039;re in France, I guess? ",83,1
Andrew,528,23,"No I&#039;m in Canada actually. Ontario to be more accurate. ",61,1
Tam,607,79,"Oh, my brother was there as an exchange student a few years back. He went to Quebec, though. ",93,1
Andrew,642,35,"Oh nice! I&#039;ve actually never been to Quebec yet. ",54,1
Tam,683,41,"He said it was alright, although rather cold. His fault for going to Canada in the winter I guess. ",99,1
Andrew,726,43,"Well to be fair, winter kinda lasts for 6 months here. ",55,1
Tam,778,52,"I am still blaming him. He planned it, he froze his ass off. ",61,1
Andrew,837,59,"We had a very cold winter 2 years ago. How is the weather in Germany right now? ",80,1
Tam,900,63,"Well, I know it snowed in two states, and there was hail here today. Way colder than last week. April&#039;s just weird I guess. ",129,1
Andrew,952,52,"Oh right. We got a bad storm here about a week ago. Other than that it&#039;s actually been decently warm. ",107,1
Tam,1020,68,"Yeah, we haven&#039;t had one of those yet. They usually happen in autumn over here. ",85,1
Andrew,1095,75,"What are you up to this evening? Or night for you actually. ",60,1
Tam,1156,61,"Mostly just hanging around, watched a movie earlier, and now I am thinking about just turning in a bit earlier today. ",118,1
Andrew,1180,24,"What was the movie? ",20,1
Moderator,1224,44,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1239,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Tam,1251,12,"I think this one was the human. ",32,
Moderator,1259,8,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
Tam,1265,6,"I am. ",6,
Andrew,1270,5,"Hello! ",7,
Tam,1285,15,"Hey, Andrew! How are you? ",26,2
Andrew,1303,18,"I&#039;m doing alright thanks! How about you? ",46,2
Tam,1325,22,"Doing fine, today was a bit of a slog but I will manage. ",57,2
Andrew,1341,16,"Oh? What happened? ",19,2
Tam,1385,44,"Just had to wait over an hour between each seminar because they basically just handed out the participation lists and quickly said what we would do this semester. ",163,2
Andrew,1410,25,"What do you study? I take it you&#039;re s a",44,2
Tam,1437,27,"Education, second semester. Do you study something too? ",56,2
Andrew,1470,33,"I study Biology actually. ",26,2
Tam,1490,20,"How long have you been studying for? ",37,2
Andrew,1521,31,"I&#039;m an undergrad student. That&#039;s my 3rd year of college. ",67,2
Tam,1565,44,"Oh, getting close to the bachelor then? Assuming it works the same way where you study. ",88,2
Andrew,1639,74,"Only one year left. Yes pretty much. Then I&#039;m hoping to start Neurosciences. ",82,2
Tam,1723,84,"Oh wow, that&#039;s a cool topic. I&#039;d thought about going into Neuropsychology, I just hope the subject is called that in English too, but just decided otherwise. Wanted to work with people in the end. ",207,2
Andrew,1781,58,"What do you want to do later? And yeah I can understand that. ",62,2
Tam,1809,28,"Just thinking about going to bed early, really. Do you have any plans? ",71,2
Andrew,1853,44,"Sorry I meant, as a job, what you&#039;ll want to do later. There&#039;s plenty of different ways to go in education. ",118,2
Tam,1972,119,"Oh! Counseling and care, most likely, especially for handicapped kids. What do you plan to do? ",95,2
Andrew,2022,50,"Mostly research on the brain and neurons, and how we&#039;re able to learn. And that is pretty cool! ",101,2
Tam,2087,65,"Yeah, I guess I am going into that from a different direction at the moment. How do we learn, but not about the mechanics, but the methods we use to learn. ",156,2
Andrew,2190,103,"That definitely sounds great. I wish you the best luck! ",56,2
Moderator,2242,52,"Time is up! ",12,
Tam,2252,10,"Aw damn, just wanted to ask something. ",39,
Tam,2263,11,"And yeah, I guess I will stay with my earlier guess. ",53,
Moderator,2265,2,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation? ",80,
Tam,2328,63,"The human one. ",15,
Moderator,2355,27,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Tam,2416,61,"I&#039;d say a 6. ",18,
Moderator,2425,9,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months. ",167,
Moderator,2442,17,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now; Otherwise you can now close this window. ",116,
