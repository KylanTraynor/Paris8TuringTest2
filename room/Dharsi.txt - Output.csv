Moderator,0,0,"Hello Dharsi. ",14,
Dharsi,14,14,"Hello ",6,
Moderator,21,7,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,31,10,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,43,12,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,59,16,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,72,13,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,85,13,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,94,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,109,15,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,121,12,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,130,9,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,144,14,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,156,12,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,168,12,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,183,15,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,194,11,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,201,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,209,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Dharsi,217,8,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,230,13,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. ",87,
Andrew,246,16,"Hello! ",7,
Dharsi,261,15,"Good afternoon! How is it going? ",33,1
Andrew,281,20,"It&#039;s going alright. How is it going for you? ",50,1
Dharsi,312,31,"I am doing good as well. It&#039;s nice to be on break. ",56,1
Andrew,335,23,"Break from school? ",19,1
Dharsi,371,36,"Yes, I&#039;m studying Computer Science. Which is why this study picked my interest. What about you? ",101,1
Andrew,406,35,"I study biology actually. I&#039;m on my 3rd year. ",51,1
Dharsi,463,57,"That&#039;s an interesting field. One I couldn&#039;t wrap my head around in high school, but hey, to each their own, I guess. What do you plan on doing with these studies? ",173,1
Andrew,551,88,"I want to learn more about the brain, the way it works, how and why. I&#039;m mostly interested in neurology. ",110,1
Dharsi,584,33,"Whoa, that&#039;s, like, one of the most complicated fields of study. Props to you. ",84,1
Andrew,615,31,"Thank you! What about you? ",27,1
Dharsi,658,43,"What do you mean? ",18,1
Andrew,684,26,"I mean, what do you do? ",24,1
Dharsi,737,53,"Well, for now my studies are mostly about maths, with little actual computing, but that will change. ",101,1
Andrew,797,60,"Maths have never been my forte... What kind of computing would you like to do? Making programs? AI? ",100,1
Dharsi,843,46,"I&#039;m hesitating between software development and networking. Although there are other fields that might interest me later on. ",130,1
Andrew,897,54,"Games maybe? ",13,1
Dharsi,961,64,"That probably counts as software development, as games are, after all, software. No, I was talking about R&amp;D, AI, Modeling, and the Internet of objects. ",157,1
Andrew,998,37,"Internet of objects like, internet for printers, watches and all that? ",71,1
Dharsi,1031,33,"Yeah, connected devices. That&#039;s a field that&#039;s about to blow up in the near future, I guarantee it. ",110,1
Andrew,1063,32,"I heard it would yes! ",22,1
Dharsi,1130,67,"Now, there&#039;s something I wanted to mention: this site looks very... French. The University of Paris, Baptiste Jacquet... Can you speak French? ",148,1
Andrew,1151,21,"Nah I&#039;m Canadian. I&#039;m sure the host could though. ",60,1
Moderator,1169,18,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1189,20,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Dharsi,1212,23,"Is it possible to speak to both actors before giving my answer? ",64,
Moderator,1242,30,"It&#039;s only a temporary answer. You&#039;ll be asked again after the second conversation. ",93,
Dharsi,1289,47,"Very well. While I am not certain, some things point to this actor being a human. ",82,
Moderator,1331,42,"Alright. The second conversation will begin. Andrew will start, and you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. ",121,
Andrew,1345,14,"Hello! ",7,
Dharsi,1356,11,"Hello Andrew! ",14,2
Andrew,1366,10,"How are you doing? ",19,2
Dharsi,1389,23,"I&#039;m doing well. Slow, but enjoyable day. What about you? ",62,2
Andrew,1409,20,"Pretty much the same actually. Still early though. ",51,2
Dharsi,1428,19,"Oh, what time is it? ",21,2
Andrew,1455,27,"It&#039;s 9:14 AM. What time is it for you? ",44,2
Dharsi,1498,43,"It is 3:15 PM. I&#039;m guessing you live in North America? ",60,2
Andrew,1519,21,"Yeah I&#039;m Canadian. I live in London right now. ",52,2
Dharsi,1575,56,"I&#039;m sorry, but I didn&#039;t get that. You&#039;re not in London right now, or else it would be 2 PM, right? ",114,2
Andrew,1613,38,"It&#039;s London, Ontario. In north America settlers had creative names. Paris is about 2 hours away in car. ",109,2
Dharsi,1650,37,"Oh, right. I forgot about this. And I&#039;ve been to Canada, I&#039;ve even seen a road sign leading to London, I should have remembered. ",139,2
Andrew,1671,21,"No worries, it&#039;s not really a big city. ",45,2
Dharsi,1715,44,"Anyway, what are you up to today? ",34,2
Andrew,1751,36,"Not much. Probably just going to take a shower and watch some TV, or play games. ",81,2
Dharsi,1779,28,"Ooh, that&#039;s interesting. What kind of games do you play? ",62,2
Andrew,1811,32,"Mostly Minecraft. I&#039;ve played Mass Effect Andromeda for most of the last week though. ",91,2
Dharsi,1865,54,"Whoa, these are two very different games. You still play Minecraft, after all those years? ",91,2
Andrew,1916,51,"To be fair I&#039;ve started late. I actually own a server, so my interest in it remains high. The game on its own gets pretty boring. ",135,2
Dharsi,1953,37,"I get that. There&#039;s only so much time I could spend on the game before getting bored of it. What&#039;s your server? ",122,2
Andrew,2016,63,"It&#039;s a mix between multiple things. Trying to keep medieval/fantasy themed, but also trying to mix aspects of other games like SimCity and Civilization. ",158,2
Dharsi,2068,52,"SimCity and Civ? In Minecraft? I&#039;m having trouble picturing the two mechanics together. Can you give me the name of the server? I have two friends who would love to check it out. ",184,2
Andrew,2128,60,"It&#039;s called Project Mango, it&#039;s still in development though. Basically it&#039;s meant to encourage building cities and empires. Mixing micro and macro management. ",174,2
Dharsi,2175,47,"This seems so deep and rich. It might even get me back into the game. Thanks for that! ",87,2
Andrew,2198,23,"You&#039;re welcome. You&#039;ve been playing minecraft much? ",62,2
Dharsi,2250,52,"I have kind of stopped, since there was no reason to really play it anymore, apart from minigames servers. But now I might pick it up again, if Project Mango sees the light of day. ",181,2
Moderator,2262,12,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2291,29,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation? ",80,
Dharsi,2345,54,"I think I was talking to an AI. ",32,
Moderator,2373,28,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Dharsi,2397,24,"4 ",2,
Moderator,2413,16,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months. ",166,
Dharsi,2434,21,"You&#039;re welcome! ",21,
Moderator,2441,7,"You can now close this window. ",31,
