<span id="time-span">03:05:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Darkwater 
<span id="time-span">03:05:18</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Good evening 
<span id="time-span">03:05:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">03:05:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">03:05:43</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Understandable 
<span id="time-span">03:05:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">03:05:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">03:06:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">03:06:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">03:06:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">03:06:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">03:06:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">03:06:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">03:06:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">03:07:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">03:07:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">03:07:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">03:07:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">03:07:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">03:07:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">03:08:12</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>yup 
<span id="time-span">03:08:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">03:09:07</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>ready. 
<span id="time-span">03:09:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:09:24</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Good evening 
<span id="time-span">03:09:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">03:09:41</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>I am doing well, yourself? 
<span id="time-span">03:09:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. 
<span id="time-span">03:10:04</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Are you ready to begin? 
<span id="time-span">03:10:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Begin what? 
<span id="time-span">03:10:42</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>A fun little game I thought of. 
<span id="time-span">03:10:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What is it? 
<span id="time-span">03:11:15</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>I ask a few questions and you answer them. 
<span id="time-span">03:11:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I can try! 
<span id="time-span">03:12:15</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Awesome, lets begin. 
<span id="time-span">03:12:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m ready. 
<span id="time-span">03:12:58</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>There are two people, you can only save one. One is a mother, one is a prisoner. Which one do you save? 
<span id="time-span">03:13:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Does the prisoner have a family? 
<span id="time-span">03:14:09</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>They both have a family. 
<span id="time-span">03:14:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Why was the prisoner in prison? 
<span id="time-span">03:15:07</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>I cannot answer that question, if i did, it would effect the questions to come. 
<span id="time-span">03:15:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The mother. 
<span id="time-span">03:16:42</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>There are two people. One is a mother of four, and one is a 70 year old lady. You can only save one, which one do you save? 
<span id="time-span">03:17:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How old is the oldest child of the mother? 
<span id="time-span">03:17:56</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Grade school age. 
<span id="time-span">03:18:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The mother. 
<span id="time-span">03:20:09</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>There are two buses full of people, one of school kids, one of businesswomen. You can save both, only if you sacrifice yourself. Do you save both, ending your life, or pick one of the buses to save? 
<span id="time-span">03:20:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Both. 
<span id="time-span">03:21:11</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>So you would sacrifice yourself? 
<span id="time-span">03:21:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">03:22:28</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Last question. Which comedian died today? 
<span id="time-span">03:22:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I have no idea. 
<span id="time-span">03:23:00</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Thank you, do you have anything you would like to ask me? 
<span id="time-span">03:23:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Which comedian died today? 
<span id="time-span">03:23:48</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>charlie murphy. Why not save the old lady? 
<span id="time-span">03:24:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Because children would likely need their mother more. 
<span id="time-span">03:24:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">03:24:41</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">03:24:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">03:25:13</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>human 
<span id="time-span">03:25:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the second conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">03:25:35</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">03:25:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:25:48</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Good evening 
<span id="time-span">03:25:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">03:26:07</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>I&#039;m well. Tell me, what is your biggest fear 
<span id="time-span">03:26:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mmm. Being forgotten I&#039;d say. 
<span id="time-span">03:26:57</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Can you tell me the three laws of robotics? 
<span id="time-span">03:28:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I remember them actually. Basically, don&#039;t harm humans even if you&#039;re told to. 
<span id="time-span">03:29:02</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>How old are you? 
<span id="time-span">03:29:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m 21. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">03:29:42</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>25. Can you physically make  a child? 
<span id="time-span">03:29:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Uh. I guess? 
<span id="time-span">03:30:17</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Shall i restate the question? 
<span id="time-span">03:30:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Might have to yes. That was pretty weird. 
<span id="time-span">03:31:07</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Can you propagate? 
<span id="time-span">03:31:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>This is even weirder. Do you want me to say that I can replicate myself thanks to 3D printers? 
<span id="time-span">03:32:41</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>yes that is fine.  
<span id="time-span">03:32:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Can you? 
<span id="time-span">03:33:04</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>I cannot replicate myself. 
<span id="time-span">03:33:31</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>What is your first memory? 
<span id="time-span">03:33:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please only send one post at a time. 
<span id="time-span">03:34:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not quite sure actually. 
<span id="time-span">03:34:33</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Where did you grow up? 
<span id="time-span">03:34:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>In London, Ontario. 
<span id="time-span">03:35:13</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Can you lie? 
<span id="time-span">03:35:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No I can&#039;t. 
<span id="time-span">03:35:39</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Was that a lie? 
<span id="time-span">03:35:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Maybe it was? 
<span id="time-span">03:36:03</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Are you asking or telling. 
<span id="time-span">03:36:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m just having fun actually. You really think I&#039;m a machine or something? 
<span id="time-span">03:36:40</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>Are you? 
<span id="time-span">03:36:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Of course not.

<span id="time-span">03:38:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>At 21? 
<span id="time-span">03:38:39</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>At 21. 
<span id="time-span">03:38:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What did you do? 
<span id="time-span">03:39:47</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>psychology mostly 
<span id="time-span">03:40:17</span><span id="name-span">Darkwater</span>How old are your parents 
<span id="time-span">03:40:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is this why you&#039;ve been trying to see if I was a robot? 
<span id="time-span">03:40:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Double posts again. 
<span id="time-span">03:40:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up!
