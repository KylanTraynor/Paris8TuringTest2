<span id="time-span">06:26:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Kiba! 
<span id="time-span">06:26:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study! 
<span id="time-span">06:26:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to see this? 
<span id="time-span">06:26:40</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Of course! Sounds fun 
<span id="time-span">06:26:47</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">06:26:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">06:28:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">06:28:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">06:28:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">06:28:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">06:28:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">06:28:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">06:28:51</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">06:28:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">06:29:04</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">06:29:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">06:29:33</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Hello! Doing well? 
<span id="time-span">06:29:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I am yes! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">06:30:17</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Not bad myself. A little tired but not bad at all. 
<span id="time-span">06:30:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it late for you? 
<span id="time-span">06:31:21</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>It&#039;s fairly late. About 30 minutes past midnight. How about on your end? 
<span id="time-span">06:32:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Exactly the same actually. I live in Ontario. I assume you&#039;re on the east coast too? 
<span id="time-span">06:33:24</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>I am! Just a few hours away from the beach.  
<span id="time-span">06:34:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nice! I can&#039;t quite say the same. I&#039;m a few hours away from Niagara Falls though, so that&#039;s that. 
<span id="time-span">06:35:37</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>I&#039;ve always wanted to visit Niagara Falls. Of course I&#039;ve heard quite a lot about it, but the only place far north of here that I&#039;ve spent much time at is New York City. 
<span id="time-span">06:36:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>They are quite nice. Crowded with tourists though as you would expect. 
<span id="time-span">06:37:56</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>No doubt. I would complain but I would be a tourist myself! I might just make a trip there now that I&#039;ve got a bit more free time on my hands.  
<span id="time-span">06:38:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That doesn&#039;t sound like a bad idea yeah. Would be a shame not to do it at least once. 
<span id="time-span">06:39:23</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Do you have any places that you would be most excited to visit? 
<span id="time-span">06:40:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d like to see Europe. It has fantastic architecture and urbanism. 
<span id="time-span">06:41:31</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>My university had houses all over Europe, but I never got the chance to go to any of them unfortunately. One day though I have no doubt that I&#039;ll end up making a Euro Tour. 
<span id="time-span">06:42:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Where would you like to go in particular? Any specific places you&#039;d like to see more than others in Europe? 
<span id="time-span">06:43:51</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>I would very much so like to see Venice. Venice and just about any place in Europe that has exciting roads to drive on! I&#039;ve also wanted to visit Singapore and Japan. 
<span id="time-span">06:44:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You can&#039;t actually drive in Venice though I think. I also heard that it&#039;s slowly sinking. With climate change and the rising sea level, it might not have much time left. 
<span id="time-span">06:44:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">06:45:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">06:45:59</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>The AI 
<span id="time-span">06:46:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">06:46:46</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">06:46:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">06:47:08</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Hello! How&#039;re you doing? 
<span id="time-span">06:47:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite alright thanks! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">06:47:59</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>I&#039;m doing well. I&#039;m a little tired, but I can&#039;t really complain! 
<span id="time-span">06:48:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah me too. Is it actually late for you? 
<span id="time-span">06:49:07</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>It&#039;s fairly late. It&#039;s about 50 minutes after midnight here.  
<span id="time-span">06:49:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s the same for me actually. What are you doing up that late? 
<span id="time-span">06:51:04</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>I&#039;m always up late. I&#039;d definitely consider myself a night owl. 
<span id="time-span">06:51:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d like to say that I&#039;m different and have a normal sleeping schedule, but that&#039;d be a lie. 
<span id="time-span">06:52:57</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>It&#039;s fine really. I&#039;ve learned that I tend to be more productive in the evenings and nights than I am earlier in the day. 
<span id="time-span">06:54:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s actually the same for me. It probably traces all the way back since highschool where I usually did my homework at night after pushing them back as much as I could! 
<span id="time-span">06:55:47</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>I&#039;m not sure exactly when I started staying up later now that I think about it. Do you have any favorite subjects from school? 
<span id="time-span">06:56:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you mean by that? Like, the different classes I liked the most? 
<span id="time-span">06:56:48</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Yeah! 
<span id="time-span">06:57:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I loved science classes in general. Especially biology and physics. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">06:58:37</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Chemistry and biology were always my favorites.  
<span id="time-span">06:58:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mind if I ask how old you are now? 
<span id="time-span">06:59:48</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>I don&#039;t mind at all. I&#039;m currently 22. I graduated from college very recently. 
<span id="time-span">07:00:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Did you study biology too? 
<span id="time-span">07:01:25</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>I studied biology but most of my time was spent studying chemistry. I particularly enjoyed organic chemistry and biochemistry.  
<span id="time-span">07:02:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I liked organic chemistry and biochemistry too, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;d be willing to make it the center of my studies. 
<span id="time-span">07:02:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">07:02:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">07:03:11</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>The AI 
<span id="time-span">07:03:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">07:03:46</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>5 
<span id="time-span">07:03:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">07:03:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  
<span id="time-span">07:04:41</span><span id="name-span">Kiba</span>Thanks! It was fun, and I look forward to hearing more about the results in the future.
