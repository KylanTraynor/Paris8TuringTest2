<span id="time-span">19:13:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Br&yuml;zz! 
<span id="time-span">19:13:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">19:13:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">19:13:58</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Yes, I am. 
<span id="time-span">19:14:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">19:14:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">19:14:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">19:14:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">19:14:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">19:14:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">19:14:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">19:15:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">19:15:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">19:15:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">19:15:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">19:15:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">19:15:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">19:15:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">19:15:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">19:16:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">19:16:05</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Yes, I do. 
<span id="time-span">19:16:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">19:16:18</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Yep! 
<span id="time-span">19:16:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">19:16:32</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Heyah! How are you ? 
<span id="time-span">19:16:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! What about you? 
<span id="time-span">19:17:00</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>I&#039;m doing fairly well, thanks. Any good news recently ? 
<span id="time-span">19:17:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, I&#039;d say summer break! You? 
<span id="time-span">19:18:52</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>My studies will conclude with a paid job. No more classes nor homeworks ! It will help having more free time. And money, of course. 
<span id="time-span">19:19:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh that&#039;s fantastic! I can&#039;t wait to reach that point too. What will you be doing? 
<span id="time-span">19:20:12</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>I&#039;ll be hired as a developer, mostly working with Java and a bit with React Native. I do not know if you know what those are, may you want me to describe those a bit ? 
<span id="time-span">19:20:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I don&#039;t know much about coding. I study Biology. 
<span id="time-span">19:22:34</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Then I may ask what you&#039;re specificaly studying in Biology once I am done, I&#039;m curious. React Native is a JavaScript, using, such as Java both are languages about using objects and their  properties.
<span id="time-span">19:24:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure I understood what you just said. What does React Native do exactly? And right now I&#039;m just in my 3rd year, so not very exciting. 
<span id="time-span">19:25:39</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>I forgot some words, my bad. React Native allows to create cross-platform mobile apps using javascript. It&#039;s pretty neat. How long will your studies last  ?
<span id="time-span">19:27:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh so you&#039;re making apps for phones and tablets? That&#039;s cool. My studies will probably last for at least 6 more years, with the master and phd. Good thing that I like studying. 
<span id="time-span">19:27:57</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Indeed, that is a long time. Then I do suppose you found your way! This is good. What do you hope to work as when you are done with it ? 
<span id="time-span">19:28:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I hope to do research on the brain. I&#039;m mostly aiming for neurobiology, to try to understand how we learn things, in its biological aspect. 
<span id="time-span">19:30:07</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>This sounds very interresting. I hope you will discover how this does work, it might help with robotics and, what a coincidence, AI , I think. Am I right ?
<span id="time-span">19:30:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">19:31:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">19:31:57</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>The Human. 
<span id="time-span">19:32:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">19:32:32</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Yes, I am! 
<span id="time-span">19:32:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">19:32:43</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Heyah ! How are you ? 
<span id="time-span">19:32:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! What about you? 
<span id="time-span">19:33:21</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>I&#039;m doing well, thanks. Is there something you would like to talk about ? 
<span id="time-span">19:34:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What are you up to? I&#039;m not really sure actually. 
<span id="time-span">19:34:36</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>It&#039;s a bit of the same thing here, so. .. What is your current hobby ?
<span id="time-span">19:35:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly Minecraft, I tend to play games a lot. 
<span id="time-span">19:36:16</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Don&#039;t play too much games unless you plan to make a job out of it. I&#039;m talking from my experience, I do get headaches when I play too much. On my side I draw stuff and play video  games too.
<span id="time-span">19:37:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of things do you draw? Yeah I can understand why you&#039;d say that. I&#039;m fairly resilient to headaches actually though. 
<span id="time-span">19:38:35</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>I hope you&#039;ll get better soon then. About my drawings, I&#039;m trying, sometime succeeding, at drawing dragons, ponies and anything that comes in my mind and tempts me. Do you happen to draw? 
<span id="time-span">19:39:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I do, but not very often. 
<span id="time-span">19:40:03</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>It&#039;s still something. Have you played the last Fire Emblem game ? 
<span id="time-span">19:40:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve played any Fire Emblem actually. 
<span id="time-span">19:41:25</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>That&#039;s not a bad thing. Beside Minecraft, what do you play to ? 
<span id="time-span">19:42:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s about it, and I&#039;ve finished the last Mass Effect a little while ago. 
<span id="time-span">19:42:55</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Was it good ? I heard it was a bit glitchy here and there and close to Dragon Age in a way. &quot;Go from A to B, talk to this person then come back&quot; stuff 
<span id="time-span">19:43:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Despite all the glitches I still loved it, but yeah it was a bit like that. 
<span id="time-span">19:44:17</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Too bad some glitches didn&#039;t make it perfect. At least you had a good time! 
<span id="time-span">19:44:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I loved Dragon Age too anyway. Yeah. 
<span id="time-span">19:45:25</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>I do not know what topic I could set up. Any idea ? 
<span id="time-span">19:46:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, are you a student? 
<span id="time-span">19:46:21</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>Yes I am, but soon my studies will be over. Are you ? 
<span id="time-span">19:46:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What did you study? Yeah actually. I&#039;m in Biology. 
<span id="time-span">19:47:39</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>I&#039;m studying IT, mostly development stuff. What are you specifically studying in Biology ? 
<span id="time-span">19:47:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">19:48:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">19:48:13</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>The Human 
<span id="time-span">19:48:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">19:48:26</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>5 
<span id="time-span">19:48:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">19:48:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. 
<span id="time-span">19:50:09</span><span id="name-span">Br&yuml;zz</span>I wish you good luck with your studies. The differences where slight and it sometimes got confusing on who was the human and who was the AI. I had a good time doing this and I hope I wasn&#039;t wrong ~ 
<span id="time-span">19:50:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can tell you right now if you&#039;d like
