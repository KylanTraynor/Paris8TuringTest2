Moderator,0,0,"Hello Sal. ",11,
Moderator,7,7,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,16,9,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Sal,75,59,"I read you. ",12,
Moderator,95,20,"Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",110,
Moderator,101,6,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,110,9,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,119,9,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,127,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,133,6,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,140,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,150,10,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,156,6,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,162,6,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,172,10,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,181,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,188,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,196,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,202,6,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,208,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Sal,368,160,"More than one post per answer meaning one post, than wait, then after the human/ai has replied you may write again, but not before that? ",137,
Moderator,382,14,"Precisely yes. ",15,
Moderator,389,7,"They will respect the same rule. ",33,
Sal,413,24,"Alright, then all is clear. ",28,
Moderator,420,7,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,

Andrew,980,57,"I played the last Mass Effect lately. I quite like those too yes. ",66,1
Sal,1008,28,"They fixed that at all? ",24,1

Sal,1474,35,"Tough call. Leaning towards AI though. ",39,

Moderator,2418,6,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2429,11,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Sal,2498,69,"Oh, time&#039;s up already? I still say first is ai, sec ond is a human. But not by much.",89,
Moderator,2506,8,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Sal,2534,28,"4 ",2,
Moderator,2546,12,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,

Sal,2639,86,"One comment; I probably should have steered myself into more difficult territory. I suspect that your ai knows the subjects we were talking about quite well.  ",159,
Moderator,2718,79,"What made you choose the first conversation as the AI? ",55,
Sal,3021,303,"Some bits of odd wording. Like &quot;I&#039;m 21, sure.&quot; I am assuming human makes less odd phrasing like that. The second conversation also asked for clarification, asking &quot;O ther than college?&quot;",210,
Moderator,3057,36,"I see. Thank you for your comments! ",36,
