<span id="time-span">21:34:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Mutationem. 
<span id="time-span">21:34:40</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">21:35:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">21:35:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">21:35:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">21:35:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">21:35:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">21:35:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">21:35:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">21:35:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">21:36:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">21:37:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">21:37:11</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">21:37:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">21:37:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">21:37:50</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">21:37:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">21:38:14</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Good thank you. And you? 
<span id="time-span">21:38:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">21:39:14</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Well currently I&#039;m thinking of questions to ask you that may trip you up.   
<span id="time-span">21:39:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ah I see. Anything interesting yet? 
<span id="time-span">21:39:57</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I do have one idea. Would you like to hear the question? 
<span id="time-span">21:40:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Shoot! 
<span id="time-span">21:41:13</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>A woman walked past a window and saw her own reflection in the glass as well as a puppy behind the glass she was interested in buying. What did she see in the reflection that she wanted to purchase?  
<span id="time-span">21:41:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The puppy. 
<span id="time-span">21:41:48</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>And why did she want to get the puppy?  
<span id="time-span">21:42:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t know. Because they are adorable? 
<span id="time-span">21:42:30</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I see. May I ask you a riddle.  
<span id="time-span">21:42:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m good at those, but sure. 
<span id="time-span">21:43:34</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>A box without hinges, key, or lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid. What am I?  
<span id="time-span">21:44:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I honestly don&#039;t know. 
<span id="time-span">21:44:53</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I have one more thing to say to you when ever you are ready.  
<span id="time-span">21:45:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m ready yes. Can I have the answer though? 
<span id="time-span">21:47:08</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Maybe later. Can you please re-wright this sentence using as many similes as you can? Here is the sentence: My name is Alice and once I fell down a rabbit hole and ended up in a new, strange world.  
<span id="time-span">21:49:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>My name is Alice and once I fell down a rabbit hole as dark as your butt and ended up in a new world as strange as your mother. 
<span id="time-span">21:50:12</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Why did you choose those words? 
<span id="time-span">21:50:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I thought they were kinda fun. 
<span id="time-span">21:50:42</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I have made my choice. What do I do now? 
<span id="time-span">21:50:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">21:51:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">21:51:39</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>The human 
<span id="time-span">21:52:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">21:52:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">21:52:30</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">21:52:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing?

<span id="time-span">21:53:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright. 
<span id="time-span">21:53:16</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Currently I&#039;m thinking of questions to ask you that may trip you up. 
<span id="time-span">21:53:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You&#039;ve got some already? 
<span id="time-span">21:54:03</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I have some questions for you. Would you like to hear the them? 
<span id="time-span">21:54:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sure! 
<span id="time-span">21:54:34</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>A woman walked past a window and saw her own reflection in the glass as well as a puppy behind the glass she was interested in buying. What did she see in the reflection that she wanted to purchase?

<span id="time-span">21:55:20</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>And why did she want to get the puppy? 
<span id="time-span">21:55:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Puppies are kinda adorable. 
<span id="time-span">21:55:56</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I see. May I ask you a riddle. 
<span id="time-span">21:56:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sure. 
<span id="time-span">21:56:09</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>A box without hinges, key, or lid, yet golden treasure inside is hid. What am I? 
<span id="time-span">21:56:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I have no idea. 
<span id="time-span">21:57:22</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I have one more thing to say to you when ever you are ready. 
<span id="time-span">21:57:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sure. I&#039;m ready. 
<span id="time-span">21:57:42</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Can you please re-wright this sentence using as many similes as you can? Here is the sentence: My name is Alice and once I fell down a rabbit hole and ended up in a new, strange world. 
<span id="time-span">21:59:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>My name is Alice and once I fell down a rabbit hole as dark as your butt and ended up in a new world as strange as your mother. 
<span id="time-span">21:59:31</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Why did you choose those words? 
<span id="time-span">21:59:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That sounded fun. 
<span id="time-span">22:00:18</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I have made my choice 
<span id="time-span">22:00:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">22:00:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">22:02:15</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>The human 
<span id="time-span">22:02:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">22:02:47</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>5 
<span id="time-span">22:02:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">22:03:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do that now. Otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">22:03:20</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Will I find out if I was correct? 
<span id="time-span">22:03:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have no further comment, yes 
<span id="time-span">22:04:11</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>I do have one question. Are you, the Moderator, the Ai? 
<span id="time-span">22:04:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>No. I do have standard things to say though. 
<span id="time-span">22:05:02</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>Then I have no further questions  
<span id="time-span">22:05:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You were right. 
<span id="time-span">22:06:20</span><span id="name-span">Mutationem</span>The main deciding factor was that the first Andrew asked to hear the answer to the riddle after I changed the subject. 
<span id="time-span">22:06:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you for your comments. You can now close this window.
