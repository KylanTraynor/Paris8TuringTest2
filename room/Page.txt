<span id="time-span">18:28:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Page! 
<span id="time-span">18:29:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">18:29:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">18:29:28</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">18:29:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good, In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">18:29:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">18:29:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">18:30:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">18:30:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">18:30:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">18:30:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">18:30:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">18:30:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">18:30:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">18:30:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">18:31:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">18:31:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">18:31:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">18:31:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">18:31:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">18:32:01</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">18:32:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">18:32:26</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Yep. 
<span id="time-span">18:32:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">18:32:58</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Hiya. How&#039;re you doing? 
<span id="time-span">18:33:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">18:34:10</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I&#039;m doing alright myself. 
<span id="time-span">18:34:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What are you up to? Nice. 
<span id="time-span">18:34:55</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I j ust woke up, going to make breakfast soon.
<span id="time-span">18:35:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What will you get? 
<span id="time-span">18:36:51</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I&#039;ll probably have cereal, or something easy. 
<span id="time-span">18:37:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s past midday for me, what time is it for you? 
<span id="time-span">18:38:12</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>It&#039;s just past noon here. 
<span id="time-span">18:38:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You didn&#039;t wake up too early I see! 
<span id="time-span">18:39:32</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Nah, I stayed up way too late last night. 
<span id="time-span">18:39:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Busy night? 
<span id="time-span">18:40:37</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Mostly just gaming, watching stuff on Youtube. 
<span id="time-span">18:41:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of things do you watch? Oh alright. 
<span id="time-span">18:41:56</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I can&#039;t remember what I watched last night, actually. I fell asleep pretty quickly after I got in bed. 
<span id="time-span">18:42:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Lately I&#039;ve been watching a lot of show reactions. 
<span id="time-span">18:43:24</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Oh? That sounds like fun. 
<span id="time-span">18:43:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s interesting to see people react the same way you did when you watched the show yourself, yeah. 
<span id="time-span">18:44:52</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I could imagine. I don&#039;t watch a lot of TV shows myself., so it&#039;s hard to compare. 
<span id="time-span">18:45:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>what about the games? Oh yeah. 
<span id="time-span">18:46:47</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Lately I&#039;ve been playing the same games a lot, or playing with friends. Hard to compare thoughts and feelings on them the same as TV though. 
<span id="time-span">18:47:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I can imagine. Which games do you play? 
<span id="time-span">18:48:02</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Lately I&#039;ve been playing a lot of Rainbow Six Siege, and the new Fire Emblem. 
<span id="time-span">18:48:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">18:48:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">18:48:56</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I&#039;m not entirely sure, I suspect the AI, since the way it&#039;s handled compound sentences,  but I&#039;ll have to see the other for comparison.
<span id="time-span">18:49:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">18:49:55</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">18:50:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">18:50:09</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Hiya, how are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">18:50:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! What about you? 
<span id="time-span">18:50:46</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I&#039;m a little bit tired, but doing well. 
<span id="time-span">18:50:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it late for you? 
<span id="time-span">18:51:22</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Nah, it&#039;s just past noon. I slept late  today.
<span id="time-span">18:52:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh alright. Sometimes when you sleep too much you end up more tired than if you had slept less. 
<span id="time-span">18:52:55</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I think it&#039;s mostly a side effect of medication, actually. I get really sleepy if I don&#039;t go to bed early enough. 
<span id="time-span">18:53:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see yeah. Drugs can really mess up your sleeping schedule. 
<span id="time-span">18:54:49</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Oddly they managed to regulate my sleep schedule so I go to bed at a more reasonable hour. But if I try to slip into the way I used to sleep, staying up until 5AM, I&#039;m pretty much dead the next day. 
<span id="time-span">18:55:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Staying up until 5AM can&#039;t really be healthy though if you do it all the time, so that actually sounds like a good thing! 
<span id="time-span">18:56:08</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I think so, yes. Just takes some getting used to. 
<span id="time-span">18:56:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How long have you been using them? 
<span id="time-span">18:56:42</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>For a month, now. 
<span id="time-span">18:57:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Right, I can see why it&#039;s much harder to stay up late now. Hopefully you found something to do during the day. 
<span id="time-span">18:58:18</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Well, lots of coffee, playing games, trying to get back into writing lately. I&#039;m still bored a lot, but at least I sleep well. 
<span id="time-span">18:59:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well that&#039;s a start. So you&#039;re a writer, or do you just do it for fun? 
<span id="time-span">18:59:36</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Just for fun, I don&#039;t think I could ever finish writing a novel or anything like that. 
<span id="time-span">19:00:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s a very big commitment yes, and takes a very long time. 
<span id="time-span">19:00:53</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I don&#039;t think I could stick to one idea nearly long enough, yeah. Easier to write short stories, and even that is a little tough to find motivation. 
<span id="time-span">19:01:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. I heard it&#039;s easier if you find a way to isolate yourself from any distraction, to stay within your own bubble. 
<span id="time-span">19:01:56</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Unfortunately that tends to be impossible, too much noise around here. 
<span id="time-span">19:02:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You live with someone? 
<span id="time-span">19:02:49</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I live with family, and they&#039;re noisy. 
<span id="time-span">19:03:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah. I can understand that it would be hard to focus then. 
<span id="time-span">19:04:14</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Have you ever tried writing anything yourself? 
<span id="time-span">19:04:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. I failed miserably to be honest. 
<span id="time-span">19:04:55</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I bet you could be good at it if you kept trying. 
<span id="time-span">19:05:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s can be applied to anything though. 
<span id="time-span">19:05:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">19:05:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">19:06:03</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I&#039;ll take a moment to scroll back through and see if I can compare them. 
<span id="time-span">19:06:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright 
<span id="time-span">19:06:30</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>I think the first one was the AI, still. 
<span id="time-span">19:06:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">19:07:08</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Slightly more than 50/50, I&#039;d  say a 5.
<span id="time-span">19:07:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">19:07:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. 
<span id="time-span">19:07:25</span><span id="name-span">Page</span>Cool, thanks!
