Moderator,0,0,"Hello Br&yuml;zz! ",18,
Moderator,10,10,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,25,15,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Br&yuml;zz,33,8,"Yes, I am. ",11,
Moderator,42,9,"Alright. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",113,
Moderator,50,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,61,11,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,71,10,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,79,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,87,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,94,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,99,5,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,107,8,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,113,6,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,121,8,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,128,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,136,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,143,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,149,6,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,156,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Br&yuml;zz,160,4,"Yes, I do. ",11,
Moderator,168,8,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Br&yuml;zz,173,5,"Yep! ",5,
Andrew,180,7,"Hello! ",7,
Br&yuml;zz,187,7,"Heyah! How are you ? ",21,1
Andrew,197,10,"I&#039;m doing alright! What about you? ",40,1
Br&yuml;zz,215,18,"I&#039;m doing fairly well, thanks. Any good news recently ? ",61,1
Andrew,265,50,"Well, I&#039;d say summer break! You? ",38,1
Br&yuml;zz,327,62,"My studies will conclude with a paid job. No more classes nor homeworks ! It will help having more free time. And money, of course. ",132,1
Andrew,359,32,"Oh that&#039;s fantastic! I can&#039;t wait to reach that point too. What will you be doing? ",93,1
Br&yuml;zz,407,48,"I&#039;ll be hired as a developer, mostly working with Java and a bit with React Native. I do not know if you know what those are, may you want me to describe those a bit ? ",173,1
Andrew,449,42,"Yeah I don&#039;t know much about coding. I study Biology. ",59,1
Br&yuml;zz,549,100,"Then I may ask what you&#039;re specificaly studying in Biology once I am done, I&#039;m curious. React Native is a JavaScript, using, such as Java both are languages about using objects and their  properties.",209,1
Andrew,650,101,"I&#039;m not sure I understood what you just said. What does React Native do exactly? And right now I&#039;m just in my 3rd year, so not very exciting. ",152,1
Br&yuml;zz,734,84,"I forgot some words, my bad. React Native allows to create cross-platform mobile apps using javascript. It&#039;s pretty neat. How long will your studies last  ?",161,1
Andrew,822,88,"Oh so you&#039;re making apps for phones and tablets? That&#039;s cool. My studies will probably last for at least 6 more years, with the master and phd. Good thing that I like studying. ",187,1
Br&yuml;zz,872,50,"Indeed, that is a long time. Then I do suppose you found your way! This is good. What do you hope to work as when you are done with it ? ",137,1
Andrew,917,45,"I hope to do research on the brain. I&#039;m mostly aiming for neurobiology, to try to understand how we learn things, in its biological aspect. ",145,1
Br&yuml;zz,1002,85,"This sounds very interresting. I hope you will discover how this does work, it might help with robotics and, what a coincidence, AI , I think. Am I right ?",155,1
Moderator,1053,51,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1097,44,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Br&yuml;zz,1112,15,"The Human. ",11,
Moderator,1137,25,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
Br&yuml;zz,1147,10,"Yes, I am! ",11,
Andrew,1153,6,"Hello! ",7,
Br&yuml;zz,1158,5,"Heyah ! How are you ? ",22,2
Andrew,1171,13,"I&#039;m doing alright! What about you? ",40,2
Br&yuml;zz,1196,25,"I&#039;m doing well, thanks. Is there something you would like to talk about ? ",79,2
Andrew,1236,40,"What are you up to? I&#039;m not really sure actually. ",55,2
Br&yuml;zz,1271,35,"It&#039;s a bit of the same thing here, so. .. What is your current hobby ?",75,2
Andrew,1316,45,"Mostly Minecraft, I tend to play games a lot. ",46,2
Br&yuml;zz,1371,55,"Don&#039;t play too much games unless you plan to make a job out of it. I&#039;m talking from my experience, I do get headaches when I play too much. On my side I draw stuff and play video  games too.",200,2
Andrew,1451,80,"What kind of things do you draw? Yeah I can understand why you&#039;d say that. I&#039;m fairly resilient to headaches actually though. ",136,2
Br&yuml;zz,1510,59,"I hope you&#039;ll get better soon then. About my drawings, I&#039;m trying, sometime succeeding, at drawing dragons, ponies and anything that comes in my mind and tempts me. Do you happen to draw? ",198,2
Andrew,1559,49,"I do, but not very often. ",26,2
Br&yuml;zz,1598,39,"It&#039;s still something. Have you played the last Fire Emblem game ? ",71,2
Andrew,1632,34,"I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve played any Fire Emblem actually. ",62,2
Br&yuml;zz,1680,48,"That&#039;s not a bad thing. Beside Minecraft, what do you play to ? ",69,2
Andrew,1722,42,"That&#039;s about it, and I&#039;ve finished the last Mass Effect a little while ago. ",86,2
Br&yuml;zz,1770,48,"Was it good ? I heard it was a bit glitchy here and there and close to Dragon Age in a way. &quot;Go from A to B, talk to this person then come back&quot; stuff ",161,2
Andrew,1818,48,"Despite all the glitches I still loved it, but yeah it was a bit like that. ",76,2
Br&yuml;zz,1852,34,"Too bad some glitches didn&#039;t make it perfect. At least you had a good time! ",81,2
Andrew,1887,35,"I loved Dragon Age too anyway. Yeah. ",37,2
Br&yuml;zz,1920,33,"I do not know what topic I could set up. Any idea ? ",52,2
Andrew,1955,35,"Well, are you a student? ",25,2
Br&yuml;zz,1976,21,"Yes I am, but soon my studies will be over. Are you ? ",54,2
Andrew,2011,35,"What did you study? Yeah actually. I&#039;m in Biology. ",56,2
Br&yuml;zz,2054,43,"I&#039;m studying IT, mostly development stuff. What are you specifically studying in Biology ? ",96,2
Moderator,2064,10,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2077,13,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Br&yuml;zz,2088,11,"The Human ",10,
Moderator,2095,7,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Br&yuml;zz,2101,6,"5 ",2,
Moderator,2110,9,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2117,7,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. ",107,
Br&yuml;zz,2204,87,"I wish you good luck with your studies. The differences where slight and it sometimes got confusing on who was the human and who was the AI. I had a good time doing this and I hope I wasn&#039;t wrong ~ ",203,
Moderator,2232,28,"I can tell you right now if you&#039;d like ",44,
