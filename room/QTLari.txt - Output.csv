Moderator,0,0,"Welcome QTLari. ",16,
Moderator,25,25,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,36,11,"Please say yes if you can see this. ",36,
QTLari,64,28,"Yes! ",5,
Moderator,75,11,"Perfect. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",113,
QTLari,82,7,"OK! ",4,
Moderator,84,2,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,91,7,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,99,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,107,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,114,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,122,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,131,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,139,8,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,146,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,153,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,161,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,169,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,179,10,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,187,8,"Do not type more than one post at a time. ",42,
Moderator,194,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
QTLari,202,8,"I understand the rules and what I need to do! ",46,
Moderator,210,8,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
QTLari,233,23,"I am ready! ",12,
Andrew,239,6,"Hello! ",7,
QTLari,245,6,"Hello, Andrew! How are you today? ",34,1
Andrew,256,11,"I&#039;m doing alright thanks! How are you doing? ",50,1
QTLari,265,9,"Not too bad, I&#039;m enjoying a day off! ",42,1
Andrew,284,19,"Oh nice! Time to relax then! ",29,1
QTLari,307,23,"Yeah! It&#039;s been fairly quiet but I&#039;ve been super busy lately! What are you up to? ",92,1
Andrew,327,20,"Not much honestly. Probably just going to be playing Minecraft later. ",70,1
QTLari,351,24,"Haha, I&#039;ve never played Minecraft! I only play simple things like the Sims! ",81,1
Andrew,376,25,"Oh I used to play the Sims too. Which one do you play? ",55,1
QTLari,394,18,"Mostly 3, although I used to play 2 a little! The city feature&#039;s really neat in 3! ",88,1
Andrew,424,30,"Yeah it really is nice to see your characters travel around. I was sad when they removed it in the 4th. ",104,1
QTLari,461,37,"I heard about that! They also got rid of a lot of core features! You would expect a new game to be more complex! ",113,1
Andrew,503,42,"To be fair there was a lot of new things. But despite all of them the game felt so much more limited. The size of the plots and all of that didn&#039;t help. ",158,1
QTLari,528,25,"I think this actor is the human! ",33,1
Moderator,537,9,"Conversation interrupte! ",25,
Moderator,552,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
QTLari,561,9,"I think I have been talking to the human! ",42,
Moderator,592,31,"Alright! We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",134,
QTLari,598,6,"Yes, I&#039;m ready! ",21,
Andrew,602,4,"Hello! ",7,
QTLari,611,9,"Hello there, Andrew! How are you? ",34,2
Andrew,618,7,"I&#039;m doing alright! You? ",29,2
QTLari,632,14,"Not too bad! I&#039;ve been enjoying my day off! I haven&#039;t been very productive! ",86,2
Andrew,648,16,"Ah yeah, I can&#039;t say I have been either. ",46,2
QTLari,667,19,"Oh? What have you been doing? I&#039;ve just been browsing the internet! ",73,2
Andrew,688,21,"Mostly just playing Minecraft. ",31,2
QTLari,700,12,"Oh? I&#039;ve never played Minecraft! It&#039;s a bit too complicated for me! ",78,2
Andrew,718,18,"Really? It&#039;s just a sandbox game. ",39,2
QTLari,742,24,"Well, there&#039;s so much to do! I wouldn&#039;t know where to start! I prefer stuff like the Sims! ",101,2
Andrew,759,17,"Oh I played the Sims too actually! ",35,2
QTLari,780,21,"Oh! That&#039;s cool! I think 3 is my favourite, how about you? ",64,2
Andrew,800,20,"The 3rd one definitely is mine as well! ",40,2
QTLari,826,26,"Oh cool! I like how much they added from 2! Like the city feature! ",67,2
Andrew,853,27,"It was so cool to be able to see your sims walk around, yeah. ",62,2
QTLari,879,26,"I think this actor is the AI! ",30,2

QTLari,922,15,"In the first conversation, I think the actor was human! ",56,
Moderator,927,5,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
