Moderator,0,0,"Welcome Fluffball. ",19,
Fluffball,22,22,"Hello fellow human! ",20,
Moderator,29,7,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,42,13,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,49,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,63,14,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,71,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,81,10,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,91,10,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,100,9,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,108,8,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,117,9,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,125,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,134,9,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,140,6,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,148,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,155,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,163,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,171,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Fluffball,181,10,"I do. ",6,
Moderator,190,9,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Fluffball,203,13,"I am. ",6,
Andrew,208,5,"Hello! ",7,
Fluffball,215,7,"Hello there! ",13,1
Andrew,223,8,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Fluffball,235,12,"I&#039;m doing quite nicely myself, and you? ",45,1
Andrew,255,20,"I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What are you up to? ",57,1
Fluffball,275,20,"Well, at the moment I&#039;m talking to you! ",45,1
Andrew,314,39,"Fair enough! What kind of games do you like? ",45,1
Fluffball,384,70,"Oh, I&#039;m quite fond of Adventure games myself. Playing the new Zelda at the moment, and I&#039;m quite liking it? Have you played that one yet, my fellow human? ",165,1
Andrew,416,32,"Nah I haven&#039;t actually. I&#039;ve been more into Minecraft and Mass Effect lately. ",88,1
Fluffball,481,65,"Oh yes? I&#039;ve heard the new Mass Effect has some pretty bad animations, what&#039;s your stance on that? ",109,1
Andrew,535,54,"They&#039;ve fixed some of it in the latest patch, so there&#039;s hope! Mass Effect never had fantastic facial animations though. But they used to be better. ",159,1
Fluffball,680,145,"Yeah, I really liked the original trilogy! Everyone complained about 3&#039;s ending, but I still thought it was a solid game overall. My favorite class was the Adept in those games, how about you? ",198,1
Andrew,760,80,"I liked the Sentinel. I think that&#039;s the name of the biotic one right? I&#039;m not sure anymore. But yeah, I didn&#039;t really like the original ending, but the Extended Cut DLC fixed most of the issues. ",211,1
Fluffball,909,149,"Have you played any of the Metal Gear games? V was a fantastic game, but kinda fell short in its plot compared to the ones that came before it . Really fun gameplay though!",172,1
Andrew,931,22,"No I never have. I did hear they were great though yes. ",56,1
Fluffball,1030,99,"Fair enough. To change the subject, have you seen the new Star Wars teaser? If so, what did you think of it? ",109,1
Andrew,1047,17,"Wait, there&#039;s a new Star Wars? ",36,1
Fluffball,1074,27,"Sure is, new trailer just dropped! ",35,1
Andrew,1087,13,"Damn I&#039;ll have to check it out. ",37,1
Moderator,1120,33,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1139,19,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Fluffball,1158,19,"I think this was the human. ",28,
Moderator,1189,31,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",139,

Andrew,1231,10,"How are you doing? ",19,2
Fluffball,1249,18,"I&#039;m doing absolutely wonderfully? What of yourself? ",57,2

Fluffball,1318,19,"Oh yes? How do you like to spend your free time? ",49,2
Andrew,1346,28,"Mostly playing video games really. Like Minecraft and Mass Effect. ",67,2
Fluffball,1380,34,"Good choices? What did you think about Mass Effect&#039;s weird animation controversy? ",87,2
Andrew,1450,70,"It was definitely deserved. The faces looked off most of the time, but the latest patch fixed some of it. So I guess there is some hope! ",137,2
Fluffball,1531,81,"Fair enough! I&#039;ve been playing the new Zelda lately myself, what do you know about that one? ",98,2
Andrew,1561,30,"Pretty much nothing actually. On which console is it? ",54,2
Fluffball,1624,63,"The Nintendo Switch, just came out recently. Have you played many Nintendo games? ",82,2
Andrew,1670,46,"Not really, except for Mario obviously. And Mario Kart on the Wii. ",67,2
Fluffball,1708,38,"Which Mario did you play? Mario 64 was my first one. ",53,2
Andrew,1737,29,"I think it was mine too actually. Was it the one in 3D? ",56,2
Fluffball,1769,32,"It was the first one in 3D, so I guess! You play any other N64 games? ",70,2
Andrew,1819,50,"I&#039;m not sure, I was quite young at that time and I don&#039;t remember most of them. ",90,2
Fluffball,1840,21,"Okay. Any classic films you&#039;re quite fond of? ",51,2
Andrew,1892,52,"I like Start Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter... and many others. ",75,2
Fluffball,1955,63,"Star Wars is great! Remember who the father of Luke Skywalker is? ",66,2
Andrew,1991,36,"Of course, Anakin, or Darth Vader. ",35,2
Fluffball,2028,37,"Correct! And remember who he kills at the end of VI? ",53,2
Andrew,2065,37,"Who are you talking about? ",27,2
Fluffball,2107,42,"You know, the evil ruler of the galaxy! Remember his name? ",59,2
Moderator,2126,19,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2146,20,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Fluffball,2168,22,"First conversation I still think was human. ",44,
Moderator,2175,7,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Fluffball,2191,16,"6 ",2,
