RubyWeapon,43,16,"Hello! ",7,
Moderator,48,5,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,60,12,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,68,8,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,76,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,85,9,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,93,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,102,9,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,109,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
