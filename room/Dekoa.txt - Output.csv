Moderator,0,0,"Hello Dekoa. ",13,
Dekoa,23,23,"Yo &#039;",9,
Moderator,31,8,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,47,16,"Are you able to read that? ",27,
Dekoa,64,17,"No problem. ",12,
Moderator,71,7,"Alright. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",113,
Moderator,79,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Dekoa,86,7,"ok then ",8,
Moderator,88,2,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,94,6,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,102,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,109,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,116,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,122,6,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,129,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,135,6,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,142,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Dekoa,150,8,"Understood. ",12,
Moderator,152,2,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,159,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,166,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,173,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,188,15,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Dekoa,202,14,"I understand the rules. ",24,
Moderator,208,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Dekoa,235,27,"yup ",4,
Andrew,239,4,"Hello! ",7,
Dekoa,247,8,"Hello there. ",13,1
Andrew,253,6,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Dekoa,263,10,"I&#039;m doing fine. how are you doing? ",40,1
Andrew,281,18,"What&#039;s up? I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks. ",53,1
Dekoa,307,26,"Oh nothing much right now. Just the usual day off. ",51,1
Andrew,341,34,"Anything special planned for later? That does sound nice. ",58,1
Dekoa,377,36,"Nothing really planned in all honesty. What are you up to? ",59,1
Andrew,424,47,"I&#039;m probably going to play Minecraft later, but about the same really. ",76,1
Dekoa,449,25,"you know, The response time on this Chat application is quite large. Don&#039;t you think so? ",94,1
Andrew,476,27,"Maybe you&#039;re lagging? I&#039;m not sure. ",46,1
Dekoa,505,29,"I don&#039;t know either. Granted it seems like this Application is based in Paris so that may be the issue with me. ",117,1
Andrew,544,39,"It seems mostly fine to me. Right. ",35,1
Dekoa,592,48,"Well that&#039;s probably because you are a lot more local. Tell me, if that&#039;s the case, what&#039;s been going on recently in Paris? ",139,1
Andrew,636,44,"I heard there had been some attacks. Well I live in Canada actually. ",69,1
Dekoa,663,27,"Been some attacks? How so? What attacks are you talking about? ",63,1
Andrew,710,47,"There were no casualties, but a terrorist attack next to Notre-Dame. ",69,1
Dekoa,762,52,"I don&#039;t recall hearing about that? Mebbe you&#039;re thinking of something from a while back? ",99,1
Andrew,792,30,"I&#039;m not really sure. That&#039;s possible. ",48,1
Dekoa,822,30,"So then tell me what is the most recent attacks you&#039;ve read about? ",72,1
Andrew,853,31,"The one in London was the most recent I think. ",47,1
Dekoa,869,16,"Which one? ",11,1
Andrew,910,41,"The last one. Not the one in front of Big Ben. ",47,1
Dekoa,943,33,"You mean the one in front of Parliament? ",41,1
Andrew,961,18,"Big Ben is the bell, right. ",28,1
Dekoa,979,18,"Big Ben is the Clocktower. ",27,1
Andrew,997,18,"No it&#039;s actually the bell inside. ",39,1
Dekoa,1035,38,"I&#039;m 90% confident that Big Ben is the Clocktower on the River Thames. ",75,1
Andrew,1087,52,"Big Bell is the largest bell inside of that tower. Sounds like you&#039;re 90% wrong then! ",91,1
Moderator,1157,70,"Time is up! ",12,
Dekoa,1171,14,"If&#039; I&#039;m wrong then I&#039;m wrong, But till I look it up then I choose to believe that Big Ben is the clock tower. ",125,
Dekoa,1174,3,"Ok then. ",9,
Moderator,1179,5,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Dekoa,1216,37,"Do i not get a chance to talk to the other actor before making an assumption? ",78,
Moderator,1250,34,"You&#039;ll be able to change your answer after the second conversation yes. You still need to try to guess right now. ",119,
Dekoa,1276,26,"Then in this case I believe I would say that it&#039;s likely the human. ",73,
Moderator,1299,23,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
Dekoa,1312,13,"yes ",4,
Andrew,1315,3,"Hello! ",7,
Dekoa,1335,20,"Hello. How are you doing? ",26,2
Andrew,1346,11,"I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! How about you? ",52,2
Dekoa,1373,27,"I&#039;m doing fine, thank you for asking. ",43,2
Andrew,1399,26,"What are you up to? ",20,2
Dekoa,1417,18,"Oh nothing much, Just a day off. ",33,2
Andrew,1444,27,"That&#039;s cool! I&#039;m enjoying summer break. ",50,2
Dekoa,1470,26,"I see. Summer this year should be interesting shouldn&#039;t it? ",65,2
Andrew,1491,21,"Should it? In what way? ",24,2
Dekoa,1536,45,"Well there are many things happening in the world right now. Combined with the winter we had it should be interesting to see how it folds out. ",143,2
Andrew,1620,84,"Well, I wouldn&#039;t mind just spending a quiet summer actually. Why do you think it will be an interesting one though? Anything in particular among the &quot;many things happening in the world&quot;? ",202,2
Dekoa,1695,75,"Well there is the Trump administration. UK still dealing with Brexit. Russia and it&#039;s continual want of trying to keep a strict control over itself. North Korea being Missle happy. ",186,2
Andrew,1755,60,"Ah right. I&#039;m not really concerned about all of that. Here we&#039;re just watching all of that unfold with popcorn. Well, maybe not the North Korea situation though, but you get the idea. ",194,2
Dekoa,1862,107,"True. Say this chat client seems to have a really large response time yeah? ",76,2
Andrew,1900,38,"I&#039;m not sure. If anything I&#039;m not noticing it at least. ",66,2
Dekoa,1931,31,"Notcing what? ",14,2
Andrew,1945,14,"The large response time. It seems normal to me. ",48,2
Dekoa,1984,39,"Well this does seem to be in Paris. Tell me what&#039;s it like there right now? ",81,2
Andrew,2018,34,"I don&#039;t really know actually. I live in London, Ontario. ",62,2
Dekoa,2081,63,"That&#039;s canada right? ",26,2
Andrew,2092,11,"Yeah that&#039;s Canada. ",25,2
Dekoa,2117,25,"how&#039;s Trudeu handling Trump? ",34,2
Andrew,2165,48,"With a good amount of chuckling and sharing champaign with the new French president. ",85,2
Dekoa,2214,49,"Isn&#039;t that Francois Olland? ",33,2
Andrew,2238,24,"Nah, the new somewhat cute one. ",32,2
Moderator,2250,12,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2269,19,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Dekoa,2337,68,"I&#039;d still say that the first actor was a Human. But I have my doubts that there was an actual AI in the midst. ",116,
Moderator,2367,30,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Dekoa,2422,55,"7 that the first conversation was a Human. 5 or 6 that both conversations were human. ",86,
Moderator,2452,30,"One conversation was a human and the other an AI, so is your answer 7? ",71,
Dekoa,2513,61,"If you&#039;re saying my answer has to be One or the other, Then I would say the first conversation was human. Certainty 7.  ",125,
Moderator,2534,21,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,

Dekoa,2585,44,"Well since this is all over now. I&#039;d just like to know which one was which since you have my answer. ",106,
Moderator,2604,19,"I can tell you after your comments, or right now if you have none. ",67,
Dekoa,2634,30,"I have none really ",19,
Moderator,2644,10,"The first one was the AI. ",26,
Dekoa,2669,25,"Interesting. ",13,
Moderator,2692,23,"Thank you very much for your help! ",35,
