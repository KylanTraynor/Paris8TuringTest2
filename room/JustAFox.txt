<span id="time-span">21:02:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome JustAFox. 
<span id="time-span">21:02:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">21:03:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you can see this, please type &quot;Yes&quot; 
<span id="time-span">21:03:38</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">21:03:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">21:03:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">21:03:56</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Okay. Go ahead. 
<span id="time-span">21:04:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">21:04:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">21:04:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">21:04:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">21:04:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">21:04:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">21:04:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">21:04:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">21:05:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">21:05:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">21:05:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">21:05:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">21:05:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">21:05:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">21:05:58</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">21:06:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">21:06:11</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">21:06:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">21:06:47</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Hello there my friend. How was your day, what did you to today? 
<span id="time-span">21:07:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s been quite alright thank you! Played a couple of games and stuff. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">21:08:42</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Hmm, what kind of games did you play and why did you prefer to stay inside when there&#039;s 20 degress outside with an all blue sky? I went  to work since it&#039;s Tuesday.
<span id="time-span">21:10:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, I don&#039;t have much to do outside to be honest right now. I&#039;ve been so busy that I try to relax. I&#039;ve been playing Mass Effect mostly. 
<span id="time-span">21:11:57</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Not having spring feelings? Come one. All blue sky and hot temperatures? Isn&#039;t that inviting? 
<span id="time-span">21:12:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, here in Canada it&#039;s not that hot. Where do you live? 
<span id="time-span">21:14:18</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>would  you like to guess where I live? 
<span id="time-span">21:14:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I can try. 
<span id="time-span">21:15:11</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>I give you a hint: the wall. 
<span id="time-span">21:15:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Trump&#039;s wall? 
<span id="time-span">21:15:59</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Next hint: more that 20 years ago 
<span id="time-span">21:16:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t really know. 
<span id="time-span">21:17:00</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Do you want another hint? 
<span id="time-span">21:17:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sure yes. 
<span id="time-span">21:17:51</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>There was something called american sector. 
<span id="time-span">21:18:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah? 
<span id="time-span">21:18:31</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Yes. There was also a russian and an french sector 
<span id="time-span">21:19:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah. You&#039;re talking about Berlin right? 
<span id="time-span">21:19:57</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Right. What was the hint that made you recognise it? 
<span id="time-span">21:20:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The last one I guess. 
<span id="time-span">21:20:28</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Do you have access to google? 
<span id="time-span">21:20:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not right now no. 
<span id="time-span">21:21:25</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Do you have a specific piece of history you enjoy? 
<span id="time-span">21:21:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">21:22:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">21:23:48</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>I think you&#039;re the AI. In case you&#039;re not, plese don&#039;t feel offended.I guess the real actor would have at least known about the wall and such much quicker. 
<span id="time-span">21:24:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">21:24:48</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">21:24:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">21:25:18</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Hello there buddy. How was the weather today? 
<span id="time-span">21:25:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It was decent I guess. A rather good day for Ontario to be honest. 
<span id="time-span">21:26:20</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Was it sunny or just less cold? 
<span id="time-span">21:27:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It was sunny actually. About 59&deg; too. 
<span id="time-span">21:27:50</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>You&#039;re talking about fahrenheit, I guess? 
<span id="time-span">21:28:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yeah sorry. I&#039;m not sure how much that is in celsius. Something like 10? 
<span id="time-span">21:28:54</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Can you convert that from Fahrenheit to Celsius for me? 
<span id="time-span">21:29:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I think I just did. I&#039;m not sure about the exact formula though. 
<span id="time-span">21:30:14</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>There comes something else to my mind. It&#039;s about this conversation. May I suggest another hint for the rules? 
<span id="time-span">21:30:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you mean? 
<span id="time-span">21:31:24</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Do you know about a character limit regarding the char input window? 
<span id="time-span">21:31:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I know there is one. I&#039;m not sure how many that is. 
<span id="time-span">21:32:57</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>It&#039;d come handy to know about beforehand. 
<span id="time-span">21:33:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ah ok. 
<span id="time-span">21:34:22</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>You know, it&#039;s a tad annoying to have something great in mind and not being able to elaborate on it. 
<span id="time-span">21:34:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You can&#039;t make it shorter? 
<span id="time-span">21:35:32</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>I had to. Was no fun. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I believe it&#039;s to make sure people don&#039;t write a book or something like that. 
<span id="time-span">21:36:44</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>isn&#039;t that a bit unpolite? 
<span id="time-span">21:37:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Why would it be? 
<span id="time-span">21:37:39</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>How&#039;d you feel about not being able to express yourself? 
<span id="time-span">21:38:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve heard someone say constraints trigger creativity. 
<span id="time-span">21:39:19</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Only if the outcome is worth the effort. 
<span id="time-span">21:39:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, what was your idea about? 
<span id="time-span">21:40:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">21:40:25</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>About explaining how my day was. Something awesome happened where I was today for most of the time. 
<span id="time-span">21:40:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">21:41:24</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Is my time over? 
<span id="time-span">21:41:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes. It was over just before your answer 
<span id="time-span">21:42:15</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>The first conversation was the AI I think. 
<span id="time-span">21:42:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">21:43:08</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>5 
<span id="time-span">21:43:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">21:43:37</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>can you tell me which one was the AI? 
<span id="time-span">21:43:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">21:43:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can tell you if you have no comments anymore. 
<span id="time-span">21:44:01</span><span id="name-span">JustAFox</span>Bye 
<span id="time-span">21:45:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You were correct.
