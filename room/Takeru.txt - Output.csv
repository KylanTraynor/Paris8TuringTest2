Moderator,41,9,"If you can see this, please type &quot;yes&quot; ",49,
Takeru,47,6,"yes ",4,
Moderator,53,6,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,61,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,71,10,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,81,10,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,92,11,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,101,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,109,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,118,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,149,31,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,149,0,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,157,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,169,12,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,178,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,198,20,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,

Takeru,333,37,"I am going okay. What do you wanna talk about? ",47,1
Andrew,354,21,"Up to you really. What are you up to today? ",44,1

Andrew,440,25,"Oh alright! What TV shows do you watch? ",40,1
Takeru,529,89,"My most favorite as of now are shows from Arrowverse. Oh, and I saw they started airing new Attack on Titan, gotta catch up on that one. ",137,1
Andrew,578,49,"Oh they did? I didn&#039;t know about that. I liked that anime a lot but I thought there wouldn&#039;t be any more episodes. ",125,1
Takeru,705,127,"Season 2 was announced for quite some time, I think. Well, 2 or 3 episodes are out now. I would more welcome to see Season 2 of No Game No Life though. Well, at least there is gonna be a movie. ",194,1
Andrew,734,29,"I&#039;ve never heard of that one. What is it about? ",53,1
Takeru,836,102,"No Game No Life? It&#039;s about 2 siblings, brother and sister, who are avid gamers with unmatched gaming skills. They are invited by god of games to live in his world where games decide everything. ",200,1
Andrew,889,53,"That actually sounds quite fun. I should check it out! ",55,1
Takeru,936,47,"Speaking of things that I enjoy, have you heard of game called Undertale? ",74,1
Andrew,959,23,"I have yes. I&#039;ve never played it though. ",46,1
Takeru,1026,67,"I hope you did not watch any spoilers. I did and I wish I didn&#039;t. Games like these are best experienced first hand. ",121,1
Andrew,1052,26,"Would you recommend it to me then? ",35,1
Takeru,1123,71,"Heh, recomend... During Christmas sale I bought it 7 times to give it to all of my friends who had it on wishlist. ",115,1
Andrew,1180,57,"Right. And alright. I&#039;ll try to get it soon then. ",55,1

Andrew,1478,20,"Oh nice! What TV shows do you like? ",36,2
Takeru,1605,127,"Sometimes I watch Doctor Who, but my favorite are shows from Arrowverse. Plus season 2 of Attack on Titan started airing recently, so I will definitely go watch it. ",165,2
Andrew,1681,76,"Oh really? I didn&#039;t know they&#039;re doing another season of Attack on Titan. I&#039;ll have to watch that too. For Doctor Who and the Arrowverse I don&#039;t know much about I have to admit. ",198,2
Takeru,1750,69,"Yeah, it&#039;s out there. I would definitely suggest watching Doctor Who, it&#039;s pretty cool sci-fi show. ",110,2
Andrew,1809,59,"I watched one or two  random episodes I believe, but I never know where to start. There&#039;s so many seasons, and the first one seemed quite old to me. ",154,2
Takeru,1929,120,"I know what you mean. I got hooked thanks to my brother. A good place to start would be with renewed Doctor Who, the episode is called Rose. It&#039;s a first episode after a long hiatus. ",188,2
Andrew,2008,79,"Oh ok. It felt a bit crazy to me, but it&#039;s probably because I didn&#039;t know the context of it all. I&#039;ll try to start there when I found some time, thanks! ",168,2
Takeru,2053,45,"No problem. ",12,2
Andrew,2087,34,"You said you watched youtube, what kind of videos? Or do you just let Youtube randomly waste your time like I do? ",114,2
Takeru,2126,39,"I have my favorite channels. Some that are information filled and then some lets plays. ",88,2
Andrew,2171,45,"I mostly watch Minecraft related videos. Depends on my mood. ",61,2
