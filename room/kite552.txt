<span id="time-span">00:36:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome kite552. 
<span id="time-span">00:36:46</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">00:36:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:37:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">00:37:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">00:37:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:37:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">00:37:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">00:38:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">00:38:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">00:38:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">00:38:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">00:38:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">00:38:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">00:38:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">00:38:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">00:39:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc)  
<span id="time-span">00:39:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">00:39:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">00:40:06</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Yes, with the only question of what will the conversation be about? Or if a topic will be provided? 
<span id="time-span">00:40:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Any topic can be used. It&#039;s completely free. Up to you to find ways to figure out which is which. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:16</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Alright, then yes I understand. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">00:41:44</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Hello there, it is nice to meet you. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s nice to meet you too. How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">00:42:14</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Just enjoying my day out of the office. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nice! What do you do for work? 
<span id="time-span">00:43:18</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>I am a Service Desk Analyst, work answering the phone for people with low level computer issues. 
<span id="time-span">00:43:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That sounds pretty useful. It also sounds kind of tiring. Some people can be a pain. 
<span id="time-span">00:45:31</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>That is the understatement of the year, but I have to say it isn&#039;t as bad thanks to the type of clients we have. Most are very professional, just not very computer oriented. 
<span id="time-span">00:46:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span> There are still people having trouble with handling computers nowadays? Other than old people. 
<span id="time-span">00:48:06</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Sadly, there is. I believe it is due to people live in the mobile age now, they are not used to sitting in front of a computer. They expect everything to be how it is on their cell phone. 
<span id="time-span">00:48:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Somehow I&#039;m imagining them touching their screen and wondering why it doesn&#039;t react... 
<span id="time-span">00:50:13</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Well funny story about that, I was just at the local computer store earlier. I felt so dumb, I was trying to demo the new macbook and I was used to my 2-in-1 at work so I was touching the screen. 
<span id="time-span">00:51:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, to be fair there definitely are quite a lot of screens that have touch recognition now, even on desktops, so it&#039;s understandable. Still feels quite ridiculous though yes. 
<span id="time-span">00:53:02</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Very true, but I can see that the desktop might not go away, but it does feel like it is going to be replaced with more mobile like operating systems. iOS, Android, etc as we move forward. 
<span id="time-span">00:54:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Probably. There will always be cases where you&#039;ll need a keyboard and a mouse though. Even if it&#039;s not for gaming. 
<span id="time-span">00:55:09</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Very true, I am sure. I am just speaking for the commercial market, where your average consumer buys and uses. 
<span id="time-span">00:55:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah that&#039;s probably true. We&#039;ll have to see what the future holds for that. 
<span id="time-span">00:56:32</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Very true, but I am sure the on the Enterprise side we have a few more years before it will change in that market. 
<span id="time-span">00:56:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">00:57:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">00:57:47</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>human 
<span id="time-span">00:58:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. The next conversation is about to start. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">00:58:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">00:58:30</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Hello again. 
<span id="time-span">00:58:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">00:59:04</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>I am doing alright, just relaxing and drinking some dr pepper. 
<span id="time-span">00:59:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh nice! Enjoying your day? 
<span id="time-span">00:59:55</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>It is going alright, just working on my computer. 
<span id="time-span">01:00:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You relax while working? Sounds productive! 
<span id="time-span">01:00:59</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Well I find working on my own projects to be relaxing.  
<span id="time-span">01:01:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>True. I usually don&#039;t really consider it to be work if it&#039;s not at least a bit annoying. But I can see your point. 
<span id="time-span">01:02:57</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Yeah, at work I have to deal with other people&#039;s problems, when I am at home I can do what I enjoy. I am the type of person who can not just sit around and do nothing all day. 
<span id="time-span">01:03:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I&#039;m like that too. If I do nothing I end up sleeping. Otherwise I always need to find something to do, whatever that is. 
<span id="time-span">01:04:55</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Yeah, but I was very excited. I been building this computer over the past 2 weeks. It is coming along nicely, just got a second hard drive for storing all my files. The OS is on a small SSD. 
<span id="time-span">01:05:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I did that for my gaming computer. Well, very moderately. I only changed the RAM... 
<span id="time-span">01:06:12</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>I don&#039;t see the big difference in the types of ram, gaming vs standard. It really is only minor speed boosts. 
<span id="time-span">01:07:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s mostly that I needed it for a specific program which loads many bitmaps at the same time. 
<span id="time-span">01:08:34</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Yeah, that is the big thing with me. I mean I guess it makes since if you like a hard core gamer or a creative professional. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Neither of those. I study biology. But I like creating worlds, and the software I use to do that requires many bitmaps of height maps loaded at the same time. 
<span id="time-span">01:10:57</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Very cool, I have toyed with virtual worlds myself. I like OpenSimulator it is a great virtual world platform, and it is opensource too. 
<span id="time-span">01:11:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never tried this. I use world machine. 
<span id="time-span">01:12:08</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>hmm never heard of that one 
<span id="time-span">01:12:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Now you have. It&#039;s great at calculating erosion for realistic landscapes. 
<span id="time-span">01:12:57</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>Ah very cool, but how does that relate to your study of biology? 
<span id="time-span">01:13:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s a hobby. 
<span id="time-span">01:13:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">01:13:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">01:14:09</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>first conversation I think was human 
<span id="time-span">01:14:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">01:14:26</span><span id="name-span">kite552</span>4 
<span id="time-span">01:14:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months. 
<span id="time-span">01:14:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do that now, otherwise you can now close this window.
