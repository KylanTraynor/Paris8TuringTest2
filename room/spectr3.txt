<span id="time-span">22:12:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome spectr3. 
<span id="time-span">22:12:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>First, do you see those messages? 
<span id="time-span">22:13:29</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>sure 
<span id="time-span">22:13:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:20</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>talking or chatting? 
<span id="time-span">22:14:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Chatting. Here. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:38</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>okay 
<span id="time-span">22:14:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">22:15:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">22:15:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">22:15:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">22:15:22</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>got it 
<span id="time-span">22:15:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">22:15:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">22:15:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">22:15:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">22:15:59</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">22:16:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">22:16:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">22:16:20</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>15 minutes for each? 
<span id="time-span">22:16:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup. We have 15 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">22:16:40</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>Hey Andrew, what&#039;s up

<span id="time-span">22:20:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m sorry to hear that.

<span id="time-span">22:22:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, she&#039;s my mother. 
<span id="time-span">22:23:33</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>Is your real name Baptiste then? 
<span id="time-span">22:23:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nope. That&#039;s my brother. 
<span id="time-span">22:24:17</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>is he older or younger then you? 
<span id="time-span">22:24:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>He&#039;s older. 
<span id="time-span">22:25:32</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>so how do I stop the convo? 
<span id="time-span">22:25:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation Interrupted. 
<span id="time-span">22:25:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">22:26:17</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>do I have to say now? 
<span id="time-span">22:26:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes. You&#039;ll be able to change your answer after the second conversation. 
<span id="time-span">22:27:06</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>I think it&#039;s the human actor the first time. 
<span id="time-span">22:27:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Ready? 
<span id="time-span">22:27:58</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>ready 
<span id="time-span">22:28:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">22:28:33</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>Hey Andrew whats up? 
<span id="time-span">22:28:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much really. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">22:29:17</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>Wondering what is your mothers maiden name 
<span id="time-span">22:29:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s Jacquet. 
<span id="time-span">22:30:16</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>more lag, how old is she? 
<span id="time-span">22:30:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>She&#039;s 41. 
<span id="time-span">22:31:35</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>how many siblings do you have? 
<span id="time-span">22:31:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve got two sisters and a brother. 
<span id="time-span">22:33:04</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>I think your &quot;human&quot; actor is just picking from a decision tree, not actually typing these answers. You can&#039;t just click your answers. 
<span id="time-span">22:33:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sorry what? I&#039;m actually typing that. 
<span id="time-span">22:36:50</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>how much time do we have left to chat? 
<span id="time-span">22:37:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure. Probably less than 10 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">22:37:40</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>why are you not sure? 
<span id="time-span">22:38:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Because I see the same things you do. 
<span id="time-span">22:42:03</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>if you were an AI then you would &quot;see&quot; a lot more than I do about this game 
<span id="time-span">22:42:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, that&#039;s because I&#039;m not an AI. 
<span id="time-span">22:43:18</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>That&#039;s what a good AI would say! 
<span id="time-span">22:43:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s also what a human would say isn&#039;t it? 
<span id="time-span">22:43:47</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>but this isn&#039;t about the AI, it&#039;s about the game. It&#039;s just a story that you both know how to tell in different ways. 
<span id="time-span">22:43:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">22:44:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">22:44:51</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>cool 
<span id="time-span">22:45:30</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>I can&#039;t tell which is which at all. 
<span id="time-span">22:45:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You need to give an answer anyway. Even if you&#039;re not sure. 
<span id="time-span">22:46:04</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>lol okay 
<span id="time-span">22:46:14</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>I&#039;ll say human 
<span id="time-span">22:46:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">22:46:36</span><span id="name-span">spectr3</span>1
