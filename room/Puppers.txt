<span id="time-span">03:46:10</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>? 
<span id="time-span">03:46:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Puppers. 
<span id="time-span">03:46:29</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>hello 
<span id="time-span">03:46:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">03:46:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">03:46:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">03:47:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">03:47:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">03:47:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">03:47:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">03:47:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">03:47:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">03:47:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">03:47:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">03:48:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">03:48:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">03:48:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">03:48:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">03:48:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post at a time. 
<span id="time-span">03:48:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">03:49:01</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">03:49:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">03:49:18</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Ready! 
<span id="time-span">03:49:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:49:47</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:49:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">03:50:02</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>I&#039;m ok, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">03:50:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright thanks. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">03:50:32</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>I&#039;m doing this test. I was playing video games. You? 
<span id="time-span">03:50:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Chatting. Which video games? 
<span id="time-span">03:51:21</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>MWO. Big stompy robots shooting big guns  
<span id="time-span">03:51:27</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>What did you do today? 
<span id="time-span">03:51:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please avoid double posts. 
<span id="time-span">03:51:46</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Sorry! 
<span id="time-span">03:52:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I mostly spent my time on homework. Took a break to play minecraft earlier. 
<span id="time-span">03:52:21</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>How was the weather where you are? 
<span id="time-span">03:52:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It was actually decent. I&#039;m in London, Ontario. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">03:53:10</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>East Coast USA. Cold in Ontario? 
<span id="time-span">03:53:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah it&#039;s not as warm as in the USA. But it was decent the last days. 
<span id="time-span">03:54:41</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>I think you&#039;re the bot. Should we keep going or do we stop if I call it? 
<span id="time-span">03:55:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>[if you want to stop, say it explicitely] 
<span id="time-span">03:56:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure why you think I&#039;m a bot. 
<span id="time-span">03:56:21</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>I want to stop because I have concluded that you are the bot actor 
<span id="time-span">03:56:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation Interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">03:57:02</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Did I get it right or wrong? 
<span id="time-span">03:57:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We&#039;ll start the second conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? (I can&#039;t answer you at the moment.) 
<span id="time-span">03:57:35</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Ready! 
<span id="time-span">03:57:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:57:47</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:57:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you? 
<span id="time-span">03:58:03</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Good, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">03:58:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. 
<span id="time-span">03:58:20</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Awesome. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">03:58:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much really. You? 
<span id="time-span">03:58:41</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>I&#039;m doing this test! I was playing video games 
<span id="time-span">03:58:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Which ones? 
<span id="time-span">03:59:09</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>MWO. Big stompy robots with big guns 
<span id="time-span">03:59:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Never heard of it actually. 
<span id="time-span">03:59:50</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Yeah, it&#039;s not very popular. How&#039;s the weather where you are? 
<span id="time-span">04:00:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s not too bad right now. 
<span id="time-span">04:00:37</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>That&#039;s a weird answer. What&#039;s it like? 
<span id="time-span">04:01:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s been mostly cloudy. 
<span id="time-span">04:01:34</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>I like it when its cloudy. You? 
<span id="time-span">04:02:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I prefer when it&#039;s sunny actually. 
<span id="time-span">04:03:22</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Well ok then 
<span id="time-span">04:03:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Where do you live? 
<span id="time-span">04:03:52</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>East Coast USA, you? 
<span id="time-span">04:04:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>London, Ontario. 
<span id="time-span">04:04:24</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Co ld there?
<span id="time-span">04:04:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not that cold right now. But it can be. 
<span id="time-span">04:05:19</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>mhm, I bet. I have a friend in toronto and he is always complaining about the cold 
<span id="time-span">04:06:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I have a couple of friends there too. It&#039;s either too hot or way too cold. 
<span id="time-span">04:07:03</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>I never heard him complain about too hot... but then its easily 100 F here in the summer so maybe he doesn&#039;t bother trying to complain about heat to me 
<span id="time-span">04:07:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>When you&#039;re used to the cold, just above freezing is decent. 
<span id="time-span">04:07:54</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>I would like to stop because I have concluded that you are the human actor 
<span id="time-span">04:08:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation Interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">04:08:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">04:08:38</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Fi rst was the bot I think
<span id="time-span">04:08:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">04:08:56</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>5 
<span id="time-span">04:09:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.

<span id="time-span">04:10:05</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Ok no other comments 
<span id="time-span">04:10:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You were wrong, the AI was the second actor. 
<span id="time-span">04:11:00</span><span id="name-span">Puppers</span>Interesting!
