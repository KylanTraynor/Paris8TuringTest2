Moderator,0,0,"Hello JonasBleats! ",19,
Moderator,9,9,"Thank you for participating in this study! ",43,
JonasBleats,26,17,"No problem! ",12,
Moderator,33,7,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,42,9,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,62,20,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,82,20,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,93,11,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,102,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,121,19,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,130,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,137,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,145,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,155,10,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,164,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,172,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,180,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,187,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,195,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
JonasBleats,217,22,"When I say stop, it needs to be in the brackets, correct? ",58,
Moderator,246,29,"As long as it&#039;s explicit enough it&#039;s good. ",53,
JonasBleats,254,8,"Okay, then I&#039;m good. ",26,
Moderator,267,13,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
JonasBleats,274,7,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,282,8,"Hello! ",7,
JonasBleats,292,10,"Hey, how is it going? ",22,1
Andrew,307,15,"I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? ",39,1
JonasBleats,333,26,"I&#039;m doing fairly good, just relaxing before work tomorrow. Trying my best to take it easy. What are you up to? ",116,1
Andrew,395,62,"Relaxing a bit before going to bed. Watching random youtube videos until I&#039;m too tired to keep watching them. ",115,1
JonasBleats,423,28,"Oh neat, what video has your current attention? ",48,1
Andrew,468,45,"Right now it&#039;s a minecraft youtuber. He&#039;s building a beautiful castle. ",81,1
JonasBleats,520,52,"That&#039;s pretty cool. Why do you think it&#039;s beautiful, though? ",71,1
Andrew,557,37,"It&#039;s very detailed and feels quite realistic. He&#039;s also using angles in an interesting way. ",102,1
JonasBleats,590,33,"Huh, I guess I wouldn&#039;t ever think of something from Minecraft as being realistic. I&#039;ve never been a big fan of the game myself. ",139,1
Andrew,635,45,"Well, he uses a modded version of it, so that might be why. I&#039;m a big fan of the game myself. ",99,1
JonasBleats,656,21,"What is your favorite feature of the game? ",43,1
Andrew,697,41,"Just the fact that you can do almost anything if you&#039;ve got some imagination. ",83,1
JonasBleats,752,55,"Do you have magic in the game at all? ",38,1
Andrew,812,60,"To some extent yes. But by default not a lot for your player. You might have to fight magical enemies though. ",110,1
JonasBleats,850,38,"I prefer high fantasy games myself, I like shooting lightning bolts. ",69,1
Andrew,893,43,"Well, it turns out you can modify the game enough to do just that. I play on a server which has spells as a part of its battle system. ",135,1
JonasBleats,970,77,"That&#039;s pretty cool. My favorite game at the moment just happens to be the Witcher and Dark Souls. ",103,1
Andrew,1011,41,"I&#039;ve never played any of those, but I&#039;ve heard good things about both, and I&#039;ve also watched others play them. ",126,1
JonasBleats,1053,42,"Any reason you haven&#039;t tried them out? ",44,1
Andrew,1121,68,"Lack of interest for Dark Souls, and lack of funds for the Witcher. It annoys me how slow the dialogs are in Dark Souls for example. ",133,1
JonasBleats,1183,62,"Yeah, but there is less dialogue in Dark Souls than in the Witcher, and it&#039;s less essential to actually enjoying the game. ",128,1
Moderator,1201,18,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1215,14,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
JonasBleats,1302,87,"I think it was the AI. ",23,
Moderator,1333,31,"Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? ",141,
JonasBleats,1339,6,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1345,6,"Hello! ",7,
JonasBleats,1356,11,"Hey there! How is your night going? ",36,2
Andrew,1392,36,"What about yours? It&#039;s quite alright so far. ",50,2
JonasBleats,1485,93,"Mine has been kinda boring. Been playing Minecraft. ",52,2
Andrew,1545,60,"It&#039;s actually one of my favorite games! Oh that&#039;s a shame, what are you doing in it? ",95,2
JonasBleats,1649,104,"Trying to figure out what I need to build a portal. ",52,2
Andrew,1693,44,"Just obsidian and a flint and steel. ",37,2
JonasBleats,1717,24,"What is the flint and steel for? ",33,2
Andrew,1754,37,"You just click on the obsidian with it to activate the portal. ",63,2
JonasBleats,1850,96,"Got it. So what do you tend to do in Minecraft. ",48,2
Andrew,1884,34,"I&#039;m a rather good builder. I mostly just spend my time building. ",70,2
JonasBleats,1940,56,"Are there any other games you enjoy? ",37,2
Andrew,1983,43,"I also like Dragon Age, and I finished the last Mass Effect recently. Yeah. ",76,2
JonasBleats,2043,60,"What do you like about those games? ",36,2
Andrew,2112,69,"Do you like those too? How your choices matter, and mostly the stories. ",72,2
JonasBleats,2155,43,"I&#039;m not a huge fan of Mass Effect. Dragon Age is okay. I&#039;m more of a Dark Souls and Witcher player myself. ",117,2
Andrew,2229,74,"Witcher has a very good story for what I&#039;ve heard. Dark Souls isn&#039;t really my kind of game. I heard good things about both. ",134,2
Moderator,2264,35,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2281,17,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
JonasBleats,2305,24,"First conversation was an AI I think. ",38,
Moderator,2331,26,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? ",89,
JonasBleats,2351,20,"I&#039;d say a 4. ",18,
Moderator,2370,19,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2377,7,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  ",118,
