<span id="time-span">00:36:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome WestOfHere. 
<span id="time-span">00:37:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:37:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you can read this, please say &quot;yes&quot;

<span id="time-span">00:40:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Here it goes 
<span id="time-span">00:41:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Try again. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:28</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">00:41:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">00:43:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">00:43:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">00:43:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">00:43:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">00:43:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">00:43:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">00:43:46</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">00:43:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">00:44:08</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">00:44:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">00:44:18</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>Howdy 
<span id="time-span">00:44:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">00:44:35</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>Doin&#039; well, and yourself? 
<span id="time-span">00:44:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What&#039;s up? I&#039;m doing alright too thanks! 
<span id="time-span">00:45:11</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>Up is a preposition in the English language 
<span id="time-span">00:45:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m sorry what? 
<span id="time-span">00:46:10</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>You asked &quot;what is up&quot;, I was answering your question in a more... literal fashion 
<span id="time-span">00:46:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh right, sorry. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">00:47:21</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>Chatting to either a real person, or a computer. How &#039;bout chu 
<span id="time-span">00:47:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I was told the same thing actually. 
<span id="time-span">00:48:13</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>What was your actor&#039;s name then? 
<span id="time-span">00:48:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you mean by that? 
<span id="time-span">00:48:45</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>You 
<span id="time-span">00:49:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m honestly lost. I have no idea what you&#039;re asking. 
<span id="time-span">00:49:55</span><span id="name-span">WestOfHere</span>Can you speak any other languages? 
<span id="time-span">00:50:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No. Not very well I&#039;m afraid. 
<span id="time-span">00:59:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">00:59:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer)
