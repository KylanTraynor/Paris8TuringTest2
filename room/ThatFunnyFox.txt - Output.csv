Moderator,0,0,"Welcome ThatFunnyFox! ",22,
Moderator,2,2,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,18,16,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
ThatFunnyFox,21373,21355,"I am finally able! ",19,
Moderator,21905,532,"Good! ",6,
ThatFunnyFox,21930,25,"Better than good! ",18,
Moderator,21963,33,"Let&#039;s get right to it then! ",33,
Moderator,21969,6,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
ThatFunnyFox,21975,6,"Roger ",6,
Moderator,21994,19,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,22006,12,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,22016,10,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,22026,10,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,22033,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,22041,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,22051,10,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,22062,11,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,22078,16,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,22087,9,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,22094,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,22103,9,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,22113,10,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,22121,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,22129,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
ThatFunnyFox,22153,24,"So I&#039;m going to be having one conversation with an actor, and then after that a conversation with the other actor, yes? ",125,
Moderator,22169,16,"That is correct yes. ",21,
ThatFunnyFox,22189,20,"Does the second actor have any access to the answers/responses of the previous actor from the first conversation? ",114,
Moderator,22226,37,"No, but remember, they are trying to portray the same Andrew. ",62,
ThatFunnyFox,22269,43,"I see!   Then I&#039;ll enjoy trying to tell them apart!  I believe I am ready to begin ",88,
Moderator,22282,13,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
ThatFunnyFox,22302,20,"yes ",4,
Andrew,22308,6,"Hello! ",7,
ThatFunnyFox,22328,20,"Hello!  Tell me about yourself, Andrew ",39,1
Andrew,22398,70,"Well that&#039;s pretty direct! I&#039;m a student in Biology, and I live in Canada. Is there anything specific you&#039;d like to know? ",137,1
ThatFunnyFox,22502,104,"Well, considering the basis of this project, it&#039;d be interesting to hear how you came to be in this situation.  In other words, what brings a biology student from Canada, here? ",182,1
Andrew,22555,53,"I&#039;m actually just helping a friend with his project. ",58,1
ThatFunnyFox,22597,42,"That makes sense.  Did you meet your friend in school, or somewhere else? ",74,1
Andrew,22637,40,"We went to the same university for a bit yes. ",46,1
ThatFunnyFox,22679,42,"That implies you parted ways, at least for a bit. ",50,1
Andrew,22705,26," That&#039;s right yes. ",24,1
ThatFunnyFox,22731,26,"How did that come to pass? ",27,1
Andrew,22748,17,"What do you mean exactly? ",26,1
ThatFunnyFox,22778,30,"If you both went to the same university, what happened that lead to your parting ways? ",87,1
Andrew,22834,56,"He was an exchange student. I live here. ",41,1
ThatFunnyFox,22859,25,"Oh I see.  And what made him think of you when it came to this project? ",72,1
Andrew,22901,42,"Nothing specific, he just needed help really. ",46,1
ThatFunnyFox,22965,64,"He needed help but he reached out to someone living in another county who he just briefly went to the same University with?    ",127,1
Andrew,23036,71,"I&#039;m not sure why that would be strange. ",45,1
ThatFunnyFox,23118,82,"It just seems to me like he should&#039;ve been able to find someone to help him who is in some way involved in his field of study, or lives in the same area, or whom he has a deeper relationship with.  ",203,1
Andrew,23187,69,"I suppose he didn&#039;t find any. I can&#039;t really speak for him though. ",77,1
ThatFunnyFox,23207,20,"How do you feel about being a part of his project? ",51,1
Moderator,23234,27,"Time is up! ",12,
ThatFunnyFox,23250,16,"Darn.  Sneaky, sneaky... Okay I&#039;m ready for round two! ",60,
Moderator,23259,9,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? (This is not your final answer) ",86,
ThatFunnyFox,23280,21,"I believe this was an AI ",25,
Moderator,23292,12,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
ThatFunnyFox,23297,5,"yes ",4,
Andrew,23303,6,"Hello! ",7,
ThatFunnyFox,23344,41,"Hello Andrew!  Do you prefer surface-level, impersonal questions, or do you mind if I ask about more personal things regarding your thoughts and feelings? ",155,2
Andrew,23397,53,"Well, it&#039;s up to you really. I don&#039;t mind either way. ",64,2
ThatFunnyFox,23435,38,"What made you decide to help out the project moderator with this endeavor? ",75,2
Andrew,23521,86,"Curiosity mostly. I want to see if they can simulate the way our brain works. What interested you? ",99,2
ThatFunnyFox,23610,89,"I enjoy intellectual challenges, and consider myself rather perceptive.  The opportunity to test myself this way was an opportunity to me.  It will be shameful if I fail to get things right! ",191,2
Andrew,23659,49,"That&#039;s not a bad reason yeah. Do you mind if I ask how old you are? ",73,2
ThatFunnyFox,23719,60,"I&#039;m thirty, and I worry about getting old.  Do you ever wish you could be young again, maybe redo certain parts of your history? ",134,2
Andrew,23779,60,"Well, technically I&#039;m still young. I&#039;m 21. I don&#039;t really think being 30 is that old either mind you, but yes, I think everyone feels that way to some extent. ",174,2
ThatFunnyFox,23857,78,"If you could reverse time somehow and go back in history to when you were younger, but keeping all the knowledge and skills you have with you now, what age/year would you go back to, and why? ",192,2
Andrew,23938,81,"Probably to when I was 16, when my parents divorced. ",53,2
ThatFunnyFox,23951,13,"Why then?  What would you do differently? ",42,2
Andrew,23989,38,"I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d have done anything differently, but I might have seen things differently. ",101,2
ThatFunnyFox,24059,70,"I suppose that&#039;s true.  It would put things in perspective for sure.  You&#039;d know the world goes on. ",110,2
Andrew,24092,33,"Yeah. How about you? When would go back to? ",44,2
ThatFunnyFox,24133,41,"I&#039;d go back as far as possible without being an infant, to capitalize on all my knowledge of future events, and make a fortune!  It was nice talking to you Andrew.  [Stop] ",177,2
Moderator,24150,17,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,24168,18,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
ThatFunnyFox,24184,16,"I feel like I am being tricked, but I think the first conversation actor was the AI ",84,
Moderator,24206,22,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
ThatFunnyFox,24221,15,"5 ",2,
Moderator,24231,10,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,24243,12,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. ",75,
ThatFunnyFox,24285,42,"Aww, you&#039;re not going to tell me?  What a shame...    ",59,
Moderator,24300,15,"I can tell you after your comments, or right now if you don&#039;t have any. ",77,
Moderator,24316,16,"I&#039;d just like to know what your thoughts are before actually knowing the answer. ",86,
ThatFunnyFox,24370,54,"Well I think in the first conversation, the responses tended to be brief and succinct, and there was a habit of confirming after the response.  &quot;Thats right yes&quot; &quot;we went to the same university yes&quot; ",219,
ThatFunnyFox,24416,46,"so that&#039;s sort of making me think it was the AI, while in the second conversation the tone was more... what I&#039;d call organic or casual, and tended to include questions for myself, as well as addition ",210,
ThatFunnyFox,24437,21,"additional information.   ",26,
Moderator,24445,8,"I see. ",7,
Moderator,24449,4,"Is that all? ",13,
ThatFunnyFox,24471,22,"That&#039;s pretty much the extent of my insight, yeah.  The second actor seemed to have more emotional and human responses, in my opinion. ",140,
Moderator,24516,45,"Very well. In your case, the first conversation was indeed the AI. ",67,
ThatFunnyFox,24547,31,"Oh I&#039;m gonna rub this in Noel&#039;s face so hard~ ",56,
Moderator,24587,40,"What was his username? ",23,
ThatFunnyFox,24592,5,"This was a great amount of fun! ",32,
Moderator,24609,17,"Actually you probably don&#039;t know that. Let me see. ",56,
ThatFunnyFox,24612,3,"Hmm... I&#039;m not sure what his user name is ",47,
Moderator,24616,4,"I&#039;m glad that you enjoyed it though! ",42,
ThatFunnyFox,24647,31,"Well I wish you luck in creating the perfect AI to overthrow the human governments! ",84,
Moderator,24650,3,"Yeah, you did not talk to the same AI. ",39,
Moderator,24660,10,"Ahah thank you! ",16,
ThatFunnyFox,24665,5,"oh wow you have multiple AIs!  I didn&#039;t know that either.  Cool ",69,
Moderator,24699,34,"We are testing different parameters yes, and trying to figure out which ones are the most visible. ",99,
ThatFunnyFox,24744,45,"That&#039;s great.  It&#039;s a really interesting field, and if I knew the slightest bit about such technical things other than &#039;it&#039;s really cool&#039;, I&#039;d ask you a whole bunch of questions.  However, philistine ",230,
ThatFunnyFox,24755,11,"that I am, I&#039;m just going to wish you good luck and thank you for letting me participate in this. ",103,
Moderator,24788,33,"Thank you very much for your interest! Your participation helped a lot. ",72,
Moderator,24801,13,"You can close this window whenever you want. ",45,
ThatFunnyFox,24808,7,"thank you ",10,
