Moderator,0,0,"Hello Kandice. ",15,
Kandice,1,1,"Hello? ",7,
Moderator,5,4,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Kandice,12,7,"No problem! ",12,
Moderator,22,10,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,29,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Kandice,30,1,"Okay! ",6,
Moderator,49,19,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,58,9,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,64,6,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,70,6,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,77,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,82,5,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,89,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,96,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,106,10,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,112,6,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,119,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,126,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,132,6,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,140,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Kandice,146,6,"I do ",5,
Moderator,151,5,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Kandice,160,9,"yup ",4,
Andrew,167,7,"Hello! ",7,
Kandice,174,7,"Hey there! How&#039;re you? ",28,1
Andrew,183,9,"I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? ",39,1
Kandice,195,12,"I&#039;m pretty well. Tired from a long work week.  ",52,1
Andrew,231,36,"Oh yeah I know what you mean. What does your work consist in? ",62,1
Kandice,251,20,"I don&#039;t understand. Are you not a native english speaker? ",63,1
Andrew,276,25,"Well I&#039;m Canadian actually. Sorry I just mean what do you do for work? ",76,1
Kandice,305,29,"I sell auto parts. You didn&#039;t answer my question, though.  ",64,1
Andrew,337,32,"Yeah I&#039;m a native English speaker. I&#039;m just having a long day. ",73,1
Kandice,376,39,"Okay. Not sure what being canadian has to do with whether or not you&#039;re a native english speaker, though.  ",112,1
Andrew,408,32,"Well Canadians speak English. Not all of Canadians mind you. I see your point. ",79,1
Kandice,433,25,"[stop] ",7,1
Moderator,448,15,"Conversation interrupted. ",26,
Moderator,458,10,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Kandice,468,10,"The non-human. ",15,
Moderator,477,9,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
Kandice,486,9,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,494,8,"Hello! ",7,
Kandice,500,6,"Hey there. Whats good? ",23,2
Andrew,524,24,"Plenty of stuff! How are you doing? ",36,2
Kandice,538,14,"I&#039;m alright, just tired after a long work week.  ",54,2
Andrew,578,40,"Mind if I ask what you do? Yeah I know what you mean. ",54,2
Kandice,610,32,"I sell auto parts at a Big 3 Dealership. ",41,2
Andrew,649,39,"I&#039;m a student myself. Oh that&#039;s cool! ",48,2
Kandice,669,20,"What school? ",13,2
Andrew,689,20,"University of Western Ontario. ",31,2
Kandice,716,27,"So you&#039;re just a hip skip and a jump away from where I&#039;m at, other side of the river.  ",97,2
Andrew,755,39,"Where are you? Oh? ",19,2
Kandice,795,40,"I&#039;m in Detroit area. Hows the area been since they closed Ontario Assembly for the Chrysler Minivans? ",107,2
Andrew,864,69,"At least not at University, nothing much changed really. ",57,2
Kandice,884,20,"You&#039;re positive about that? ",33,2
Andrew,905,21,"I guess yeah. ",14,2
Kandice,937,32,"No big change when they closed it down in 2010? ",48,2
Andrew,992,55,"Not that I noticed at least. ",29,2
Kandice,1033,41,"Are you from Ontario? ",22,2
Andrew,1059,26,"But to be honest I didn&#039;t know it had even closed so... yeah. ",67,2
Kandice,1086,27,"You know which plant im talking about, right? ",46,2
Andrew,1179,93,"I don&#039;t really follow politics, or car issues. Not really. ",64,2
Kandice,1252,73,"I mean, its a huge building. Youve probably driven by it on 401 a bunch.  ",74,2
Andrew,1288,36,"I might have. I never paid attention to it though. ",51,2
Kandice,1325,37,"Okay. For the second time, are you from ontario? ",49,2
Andrew,1354,29,"Yes I am. I&#039;ve lived in London since I was born. ",54,2
Moderator,1408,54,"Time is up! ",12,
Kandice,1420,12,"Thnak god ",10,
Moderator,1427,7,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation? ",80,
Kandice,1454,27,"Hard to say. Neither one seems to have ever spoken english before. First one was a human.  ",91,
Moderator,1469,15,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Kandice,1483,14,"four ",5,
Moderator,1492,9,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,1497,5,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. ",107,
Kandice,1526,29,"Yeah, so both of them have a very poor grasp on the English language.  ",71,
Andrew,1539,13,"What makes you think so? ",25,
Kandice,1540,1,"Very poor comprehension.  ",26,
Kandice,1582,42,"They both either are not native speakers, or are incredibly rude.  ",67,
Andrew,1620,38,"Do you have specific quotes? Or was it just in general? ",56,
Kandice,1654,34,"AndrewOh yeah I know what you mean. What does your work consist in? KandiceI don&#039;t understand. Are you not a native english speaker? AndrewWell I&#039;m Canadian actually. Sorry I just mean what do you do ",210,
Kandice,1689,35,"KandiceAre you from Ontario? AndrewBut to be honest I didn&#039;t know it had even closed so... yeah. KandiceYou know which plant im talking about, right? AndrewI don&#039;t really follow politics, or car issue",210,
Moderator,1736,47,"I&#039;m not sure what makes it all seem rude, but your comment is noted. ",74,
Kandice,1740,4,"Both avoided questions. I was very put off by this. Please tag this for people, like myself, who can be triggered by this.  ",124,
Kandice,1806,66,"Do you not think that avoiding questions in a conversation is rude? ",68,
Moderator,1847,41,"I&#039;d like to apologize in the name of this study if these sentences felt misplaced or hurtful, it certainly wasn&#039;t the intention behind them. ",151,
Kandice,1853,6,"And not just stating that you don&#039;t feel comfortable answering them, but requiring me to ask a second time to get a concrete answer.  ",139,
Moderator,1856,3,"And yes, it can be. ",20,
Kandice,1873,17,"So what about them avoiding questions was not rude? ",52,
Moderator,1912,39,"I think they might have believed that they were giving you more information that way, than just a binary yes no answer. ",120,
Kandice,1994,82,"They&#039;re both terribly misinformed. I sincerely hope that the selection for actors is not at all a reflection of the university, because it sure seems that way.  ",166,
Kandice,2081,87,"Will you be warning future volunteers of all of the possible triggers? I&#039;m curios as to why I did not get any trigger warnings.  ",134,
Moderator,2106,25,"Conveying an accurate amount of information about Ontario wasn&#039;t quite the scope of this study, and such specific questions have never come up before. We were indeed not prepared enough on this topic.",205,
Moderator,2168,62,"I deeply apologize for the emotional stress this caused you. In case you&#039;d like to know, you were right, the AI was indeed the second one. ",144,
Kandice,2217,49,"You need to include all applicable trigger warnings. Others are not as robust as I am.  ",88,
Kandice,2236,19,"How can I contact someone to insure that this happens? ",55,
Moderator,2241,5,"What do you mean by that exactly, if you don&#039;t mind? ",58,
Moderator,2257,16,"About the triggers I mean. ",27,
Kandice,2274,17,"You don&#039;t know what trigger warnings are? ",47,
Moderator,2331,57,"I don&#039;t know the specific term, but I might know what it means, I&#039;d just like to know exactly what you mean so that I don&#039;t guess wrong. ",152,
Kandice,2361,30,"For instance, one of the trigger warnings that needs to be included is &quot;Male Name&quot; ",93,
Kandice,2387,26,"Some people may be put off by the name andrew, or male names in general. An option needs to be given.  ",103,
Kandice,2399,12,"Another is &quot;Question Avoidance&quot; ",42,
Kandice,2447,48,"Also, speaking of question avoidance, I&#039;ll ask AGAIN, How can I contact someone to insure that this (trigger warning implementation)  happens? ",148,
Moderator,2467,20,"You don&#039;t need to. You&#039;re doing that right now. ",58,
Kandice,2511,44,"So if i take this survey again in a day, I&#039;ll receive extensive trigger warnings? ",87,
Kandice,2523,12,"I&#039;m sorry, i misused the word survey.  ",44,
Kandice,2535,12,"I hope you understand what I meant.  ",37,
Moderator,2579,44,"No, this study can&#039;t be changed without introducing a bias, but it will be added in future studies. This is the first time a situation like this has happened in more than 120 people across two years. ",205,
Kandice,2618,39,"You&#039;re not studying a wide enough demographic.  ",53,
Kandice,2658,40,"When will i receive notification of implementation and my compensation? ",72,
Moderator,2686,28,"I&#039;m sorry, what? ",22,
Kandice,2709,23,"When will I be notified that you implemented trigger warnings? ",63,
Kandice,2737,28,"When will I receive compensation for emotional distress? ",57,
Moderator,2812,75,"As I said, we can&#039;t implement this in the current study. And for the compensation, the only thing I can offer is to pull out this conversation from this study, as well as your answers in the survey. ",204,
Moderator,2843,31,"I mean form. ",13,
Kandice,2890,47,"So you think that you can potentially terrorize people with no repercussions? I understand. Please send me an E-mail to the provided address when you do the next study, complete with trigger warnings.",200,
Kandice,2927,37,"You need not say anything else. Goodbye.  ",42,
Moderator,2965,38,"I do not think that. But Goodbye, and sorry again. ",51,
Moderator,2976,11,"You can now close this window. ",31,
