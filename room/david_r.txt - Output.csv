Moderator,0,0,"Hello david_r. ",15,
Moderator,35,35,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
david_r,44,9,"My pleasure <img src='smiles/smile.gif'/> ",42,
Moderator,50,6,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,55,5,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
david_r,63,8,"Sure. ",6,
Moderator,65,2,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,72,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,80,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,88,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,97,9,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,104,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,113,9,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,123,10,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,136,13,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,145,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,153,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,162,9,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,174,12,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,183,9,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
david_r,191,8,"Yes, I do. ",11,
Moderator,197,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. ",87,
Andrew,204,7,"Hello! ",7,
david_r,205,1,"Okay. ",6,
david_r,225,20,"Hello, Andrew. ",15,1
Andrew,236,11,"How are you doing? ",19,1
david_r,250,14,"I&#039;m doing alright. Yourself? ",34,1
Andrew,260,10,"I&#039;m quite good. What are you up to? ",41,1
david_r,290,30,"Procrastinating... I&#039;m supposed to be doing some work but I&#039;m way too lazy right now. ",96,1
Andrew,310,20,"I know the feeling very well believe me. What kind of work do you have to do? ",78,1
david_r,354,44,"I&#039;m helping out the local synagogue with their website... it&#039;s just a side gig. ",90,1
Andrew,399,45,"I take it you&#039;re in IT? Or do you just make websites for fun? ",67,1
david_r,458,59,"I am in IT, but in a different field. I&#039;m not really a professional web designer. ",87,1
Andrew,493,35,"I see. In which field are you? ",31,1
david_r,540,47,"I am a computational linguist. How about you? What do you do for a living? ",75,1
Andrew,590,50,"At the moment I study Biology. I don&#039;t actually have a job, other than the one I use to pay the tuition fees. ",115,1
david_r,607,17,"Which is..? ",12,1
Andrew,624,17,"Working at the university&#039;s KFC. ",38,1
david_r,655,31,"You must be sick and tired of chicken! ",39,1
Andrew,670,15,"I&#039;m mostly sick and tired of customers to be honest. ",58,1
david_r,723,53,"What annoys you most in customer service? ",42,1
Andrew,774,51,"When they start randomly harassing you for not being fast enough. Fortunately students are not the most annoying customers. ",124,1
david_r,837,63,"Okay, I&#039;ll bite. Who are the worst ones? ",46,1
Andrew,908,71,"Not sure actually. Being within the university&#039;s walls, I don&#039;t see many others. It&#039;s just that it could be worse. ",130,1
david_r,950,42,"Is this your first ever job? ",29,1
Andrew,964,14,"Yup, it is. ",12,1
david_r,1087,123,"What are you interested in within the field of biology? Lots of interesting stuff there. ",89,1
Andrew,1126,39,"Definitely. Mostly trying to figure out how the brain works. Basically everything related to neurology. ",104,1
Moderator,1133,7,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1147,14,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
david_r,1190,43,"I think it was a human, but to be honest I&#039;ll need the second actor to be sure. ",85,
Andrew,1232,42,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, and you&#039;ll have 15 minutes maximum after your answer. ",127,
Andrew,1248,16,"Hello! ",7,
david_r,1257,9,"Hey, Andrew. ",13,2
Andrew,1266,9,"How are you doing? ",19,2
david_r,1276,10,"I&#039;m doing just fine. Yourself? ",36,2
Andrew,1292,16,"I&#039;m doing alright. What&#039;s up? ",40,2
david_r,1320,28,"Just avoiding doing some work... nothing major. ",48,2
Andrew,1338,18,"Sounds like procrastinating. I know the feeling. ",49,2
david_r,1440,102,"It&#039;s been a long day, I just want to kick back and not really do much. ",76,2
Andrew,1476,36,"Just a boring day or have you been busy? ",41,2
david_r,1522,46,"Work has been murder. Loads of stuff to do, not nearly enough time or people. ",78,2
Andrew,1546,24,"Oh I see. What kind of work is it? ",35,2
david_r,1587,41,"I&#039;m a linguist. ",21,2
Andrew,1627,40,"Oh that sounds really cool! What kind of linguist? ",51,2
david_r,1674,47,"By training I&#039;m a historical linguist, but I actually mostly work natural language understanding. ",103,2
Andrew,1761,87,"Sounds like we&#039;d have things to talk about then. I want to study the brain and the cognitive processes underlying behaviors. ",130,2
david_r,1806,45,"That&#039;s definitely fascinating. I have only a tangential understanding of this stuff. You are the future, mate. ",116,2
Andrew,1870,64,"Both of us then. Especially about language understanding. ",58,2
david_r,1929,59,"There&#039;s lots of work to be done, still. Which is good, since I don&#039;t want to be out of a job. ",104,2
Andrew,1984,55,"It&#039;s a good thing that it&#039;s very demanded lately. Neither do I.  ",75,2
david_r,2018,34,"Do you see yourself in academia? Or making a career in a corporation? ",70,2
Andrew,2052,34,"Maybe corporation and academia. They are not mutually exclusive. ",65,2
david_r,2107,55,"I find it a little dodgy when people do both. It&#039;s not really good for academia, in my opinion. ",101,2
Andrew,2138,31,"Sometimes they have partnerships. ",34,2
Moderator,2151,13,"Time is up! ",12,
david_r,2167,16,"Okay. ",6,
Moderator,2171,4,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation? ",80,
david_r,2186,15,"I still think that was the human. ",34,
Moderator,2193,7,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how comfident are you of your answer? ",90,
david_r,2224,31,"2. ",3,
