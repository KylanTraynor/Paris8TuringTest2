<span id="time-span">23:21:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Relius! 
<span id="time-span">23:21:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:05</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Its no problem. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:51</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Ok. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:23:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:23:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:23:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:23:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:23:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:23:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:23:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">23:23:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">23:24:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:24:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:24:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:24:22</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>I do. 
<span id="time-span">23:24:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready?  
<span id="time-span">23:24:41</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>I am. 
<span id="time-span">23:24:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:24:54</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:25:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:25:09</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Not bad, how about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:25:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:25:52</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Nothing too interesting, just messing with friends. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds fun enough. I&#039;m not doing much myself right now. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:47</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Do you like any sports? 
<span id="time-span">23:27:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nah, I&#039;m not really a sports person. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:28:00</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>I&#039;m not too much of one either. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of things do you like? 
<span id="time-span">23:29:06</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Books, games. I&#039;m more of an indoors person, more academic than sporty. 
<span id="time-span">23:29:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d be the same actually. Mind if I ask how old you are? 
<span id="time-span">23:29:47</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>I&#039;m twenty, how old are you? 
<span id="time-span">23:30:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Just one year older than you: 21. 
<span id="time-span">23:30:36</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>What&#039;s your favorite book, show, game, etc.? 
<span id="time-span">23:31:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t know if I have a favorite book or game, but I absolutely love Game of Thrones. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:16</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>What do you love about it? 
<span id="time-span">23:32:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How real the characters feel. They don&#039;t feel empty, or like filler characters. They all have their own stories. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:29</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Do you have a favorite character? 
<span id="time-span">23:33:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It would have to be Tyrion yeah. You? 
<span id="time-span">23:33:30</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Not sure, I kinda fell out of watching it. 
<span id="time-span">23:33:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Why? 
<span id="time-span">23:34:04</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Not sure why, life kinda got in the way... What foods do you like? 
<span id="time-span">23:34:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, that&#039;s probably going to sound very generic, but I love pizza. Especially ones with chicken and ground beef. 
<span id="time-span">23:35:31</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Could you describe to me how it tastes? Like the consistency, the flavors, and how it smells? 
<span id="time-span">23:36:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You mean in absolute? Or compared to other things. Because feelings are really not easy to describe in the absolute... It&#039;s like trying to explain what color is to someone who&#039;s blind. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:48</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Describe it however you best can. 
<span id="time-span">23:39:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, the crust is usually a bit crunchy, but it really depends on the type of pizza, the rest is much softer thanks to the tomato sauce and the cheese. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:40:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">23:41:12</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Well... all answers were reasonable, if a bit... easy to say. It could be either or. 
<span id="time-span">23:41:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>It&#039;s not your final answer, you&#039;ll be able to change it after the next conversation, but you still need to give one answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:26</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Mmmm... I&#039;ll say actual person. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:43:00</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>I am. 
<span id="time-span">23:43:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:43:18</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Hello! How are you 
<span id="time-span">23:43:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:02</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Not bad... May I ask what you look like? 
<span id="time-span">23:45:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, I&#039;m about 6&#039; tall, I have dark hair and dark eyes. Sure! 
<span id="time-span">23:45:30</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>What is your favorite memory? 
<span id="time-span">23:46:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m actually not sure though. What is yours? That&#039;s a good question. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:37</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Mine is an ancient one from when I lived in Ireland. Where are you from? 
<span id="time-span">23:48:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>In a city called London in the Ontario. I still live there and I was born in Canada.  
<span id="time-span">23:50:10</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Could you tell me what you think is the most striking, most interesting thing there? What do you think defines the actual physical city? 
<span id="time-span">23:51:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Only the university is worth checking out. There&#039;s nothing much here to be honest. 
<span id="time-span">23:51:34</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Do you study or work at the university? What do you do there? 
<span id="time-span">23:52:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m in summer break right now, but I study biology. 
<span id="time-span">23:52:30</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Why biology? What brought your interests there? 
<span id="time-span">23:53:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What makes us feel and think, mostly studying the brain really. 
<span id="time-span">23:53:49</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>What is your favorite food? 
<span id="time-span">23:55:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I know that&#039;s pretty generic, and it would have to be pizza. 
<span id="time-span">23:55:34</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Could you describe to me how it tastes? Like the consistency, the flavors, and how it smells? 
<span id="time-span">23:57:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not really sure. That&#039;s a bit weird, but I guess I could. At least that&#039;s how I like it, rather soft in the middle and smelling spicy. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:44</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Ask me a question. 
<span id="time-span">23:58:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:58:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">23:59:29</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Well, the answers were rather generic, anyone could have been talking. I&#039;m thinking the first one was an AI. 
<span id="time-span">23:59:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">00:01:07</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>About a five. 
<span id="time-span">00:01:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">00:01:55</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Thank you. 
<span id="time-span">00:02:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">00:02:34</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>May I ask what the correct answer was? 
<span id="time-span">00:02:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you don&#039;t have any comments I can tell you right now, otherwise I&#039;ll tell you after your comments. 
<span id="time-span">00:04:53</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>I think the first one was an AI, as I said, because everything was generic, anyone could have said it. And while I may have not asked all the right questions, the second one was more specific. 
<span id="time-span">00:05:01</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>I have no further comments than that. 
<span id="time-span">00:05:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. The first one was actually the human. 
<span id="time-span">00:06:12</span><span id="name-span">Relius</span>Well, thank you for letting participate in this experiment. Good bye. 
<span id="time-span">00:06:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you very much for your help!
