Moderator,0,0,"Hello Robopanda ",16,
Robopanda,7,7,"And I have appeared. ",21,
Moderator,12,5,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,26,14,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Robopanda,32,6,"Yep ",4,
Moderator,43,11,"Alright. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",113,
Moderator,52,9,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,62,10,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Robopanda,63,1,"Okie dokie ",11,
Moderator,71,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,78,7,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,87,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,95,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,101,6,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,108,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,116,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,123,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,130,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,137,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,146,9,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,154,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,161,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Robopanda,170,9,"Yep. ",5,
Moderator,175,5,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Robopanda,183,8,"Yep. ",5,
Andrew,188,5,"Hello! ",7,
Robopanda,197,9,"Yo, how&#039;re you doing? ",27,1
Andrew,210,13,"I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? ",39,1
Robopanda,236,26,"I&#039;m pretty good. So, are you a male or female? The name Andrew makes me think male, but you never really know ya know? ",124,1
Andrew,260,24,"Ahah yes, I&#039;m male. You? ",30,1
Robopanda,296,36,"Male as-well. Do you have anything you&#039;d like to be answered in particular? ",81,1
Andrew,331,35,"It&#039;s up to you really. How old are you? ",45,1
Robopanda,354,23,"I&#039;m 19. How would you describe the color grey? ",52,1
Andrew,407,53,"Well, it depends to whom I&#039;d be talking to. If they are not blind I&#039;d say it&#039;s between white and black, but if they are blind it&#039;s hard to describe a color anyway. ",184,1
Robopanda,488,81,"That&#039;s true. And it is quite an in-between, isn&#039;t it? So many shades. Some people would say that grey is boring. But there are so many things that are just called &#039;grey&#039;. ",191,1
Andrew,560,72,"Indeed, so many shades of Grey! ",32,1
Robopanda,622,62,"That&#039;s one of the reasons it&#039;s my favorite color. There are so many ways you can look at grey that can change by the light-level and so many other factors, it&#039;s so... simple, but complicated. ",207,1
Andrew,703,81,"It&#039;s also very classy and a bit mysterious. ",49,1
Robopanda,735,32,"Mm, that&#039;s also true. Do you have a favorite color? Do you prefer warm or cool colors? ",92,1
Andrew,802,67,"I don&#039;t think I really have a favorite color actually. It really depends on what you&#039;d apply it to. In general I like blue and purple though, but I can&#039;t really say they are my favorite colors either.",215,1
Robopanda,860,58,"Hmm, very nice to know. So you tend to prefer cooler colors. A friend of mine tends to associate purple with me, for one reason or another. ",140,1
Andrew,902,42,"I wonder why. I know someone who loves purple so much that I try to wear something of that color each time I see her. ",118,1
Robopanda,960,58,"Well that&#039;s always a nice thing to do for a friend. Do you enjoy video games? ",83,1
Andrew,990,30,"I do yes. I spend a lot of my time on Minecraft. ",49,1
Robopanda,1048,58,"Mm, I don&#039;t particularly like minecraft. I need something with a bit more direction. Like Colony Sims where you have to survive, or RPGs where you have to take on the big bad. ",181,1
Andrew,1078,30,"Right, I&#039;ve finished the last Mass Effect a little while ago. ",67,1
Moderator,1101,23,"Time is up! ",12,
Robopanda,1118,17,"Mm, I think that&#039;s the AI. ",32,
Moderator,1136,18,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
Robopanda,1146,10,"Yup ",4,
Andrew,1151,5,"Hello! ",7,
Robopanda,1177,26,"Yo, what&#039;s up? ",20,2
Andrew,1199,22,"How are you doing? Not much! ",29,2
Robopanda,1233,34,"I&#039;m pretty good. So, do you prefer warm colors or cool colors? ",68,2
Andrew,1261,28,"I guess it depends on the context, I&#039;m not really sure. ",61,2
Robopanda,1295,34,"Mm, I see I see. No problem there, then. Do you enjoy FPS games? ",65,2
Andrew,1361,66,"Not really no. I play a lot of Minecraft, and I tend to prefer RPGs. ",69,2
Robopanda,1388,27,"Mm, RPGs can be quite fun. What would you say is your favorite RPG? ",68,2
Andrew,1444,56,"What about you? The last one I played was Mass Effect and I like the Final Fantasy series in general. ",102,2
Robopanda,1510,66,"Mm, I like Colony Sims and RPGs, one of my favorites is Skyrim when it comes to RPGs, and for colony Sims I grew up with Virtual Villagers  and I&#039;ve been playing a lot of RimWorld lately.",192,2
Andrew,1547,37,"Except for Skyrim, I don&#039;t know any of those. ",51,2
Robopanda,1616,69,"Virtual Villagers is an older game, it&#039;s actually a series now with five games in it and the first one now having the title &#039;Origins&#039;. RimWorld is an early access game. ",184,2
Andrew,1654,38,"What do you do in them? Oh alright. ",36,2
Robopanda,1705,51,"With Virtual Villagers you control a little colony, starting with 12 people, and try to make it so that they can all survive. RimWorld is similar, but much less hands-on, setting goals instead of cont",200,2
Andrew,1742,37,"It sounds a bit like another game I played called Banished. ",60,2
Robopanda,1784,42,"Banished is similar to the two, but it&#039;s also a lot different. It&#039;s harder than Virtual Villagers, for one, and you have so many more people, and you can&#039;t customize them to much of a degree. ",207,2
Andrew,1852,68,"I might have to try those games later then. Right I see. ",57,2
Robopanda,1908,56,"Mmhmm. You can get the first Virtual Villagers for free on mobile. ",67,2
Andrew,1943,35,"What kind of mobile? ",21,2
Robopanda,1964,21,"Android, I don&#039;t know about apple. ",40,2
Andrew,2008,44,"Thanks for the advice! Ok good. ",32,2
Robopanda,2061,53,"[STOP] ",7,2
Moderator,2077,16,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Robopanda,2087,10,"Actore Two is the AI. ",22,
Moderator,2107,20,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Robopanda,2113,6,"6 ",2,
Moderator,2122,9,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2143,21,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. ",107,
