<span id="time-span">22:11:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Tam. 
<span id="time-span">22:11:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:11:54</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>No problem, got some time to kill. 
<span id="time-span">22:12:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">22:12:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">22:12:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:12:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">22:12:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">22:12:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">22:14:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">22:14:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">22:14:41</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>I do. Any other kinds of posts that are to be avoided? 
<span id="time-span">22:15:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Not necessarily. But try to keep talking to Andrew, not the actors. 
<span id="time-span">22:16:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Any other questions? 
<span id="time-span">22:16:20</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Don&#039;t think so. 
<span id="time-span">22:16:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">22:16:37</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">22:16:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">22:16:53</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Hello, Andrew! How has your day been? 
<span id="time-span">22:17:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s been quite alright thanks! What about your day? 
<span id="time-span">22:17:33</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>It was okay, first week of Uni is always a bit boring. Are you a student too, or what do you do? 
<span id="time-span">22:18:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I study Biology yes. Why is this your first week though? Isn&#039;t it halfway through the year already? 
<span id="time-span">22:18:58</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Not where I live. The semester just started this Monday - or rather this Tuesday, since the Monday was a holiday. 
<span id="time-span">22:19:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh alright. Where do you live? If you don&#039;t mind me asking. 
<span id="time-span">22:19:56</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Germany, that is as specific as I am going to get. You&#039;re in France, I guess? 
<span id="time-span">22:20:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No I&#039;m in Canada actually. Ontario to be more accurate. 
<span id="time-span">22:21:38</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Oh, my brother was there as an exchange student a few years back. He went to Quebec, though. 
<span id="time-span">22:22:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh nice! I&#039;ve actually never been to Quebec yet. 
<span id="time-span">22:22:54</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>He said it was alright, although rather cold. His fault for going to Canada in the winter I guess. 
<span id="time-span">22:23:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well to be fair, winter kinda lasts for 6 months here. 
<span id="time-span">22:24:29</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>I am still blaming him. He planned it, he froze his ass off. 
<span id="time-span">22:25:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>We had a very cold winter 2 years ago. How is the weather in Germany right now? 
<span id="time-span">22:26:31</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Well, I know it snowed in two states, and there was hail here today. Way colder than last week. April&#039;s just weird I guess. 
<span id="time-span">22:27:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh right. We got a bad storm here about a week ago. Other than that it&#039;s actually been decently warm. 
<span id="time-span">22:28:31</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Yeah, we haven&#039;t had one of those yet. They usually happen in autumn over here. 
<span id="time-span">22:29:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What are you up to this evening? Or night for you actually. 
<span id="time-span">22:30:47</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Mostly just hanging around, watched a movie earlier, and now I am thinking about just turning in a bit earlier today. 
<span id="time-span">22:31:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What was the movie? 
<span id="time-span">22:31:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">22:32:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">22:32:22</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>I think this one was the human. 
<span id="time-span">22:32:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">22:32:36</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>I am. 
<span id="time-span">22:32:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">22:32:56</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Hey, Andrew! How are you? 
<span id="time-span">22:33:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright thanks! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">22:33:36</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Doing fine, today was a bit of a slog but I will manage. 
<span id="time-span">22:33:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh? What happened? 
<span id="time-span">22:34:36</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Just had to wait over an hour between each seminar because they basically just handed out the participation lists and quickly said what we would do this semester. 
<span id="time-span">22:35:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you study? I take it you&#039;re s a
<span id="time-span">22:35:28</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Education, second semester. Do you study something too? 
<span id="time-span">22:36:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I study Biology actually. 
<span id="time-span">22:36:21</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>How long have you been studying for? 
<span id="time-span">22:36:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m an undergrad student. That&#039;s my 3rd year of college. 
<span id="time-span">22:37:36</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Oh, getting close to the bachelor then? Assuming it works the same way where you study. 
<span id="time-span">22:38:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Only one year left. Yes pretty much. Then I&#039;m hoping to start Neurosciences. 
<span id="time-span">22:40:14</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Oh wow, that&#039;s a cool topic. I&#039;d thought about going into Neuropsychology, I just hope the subject is called that in English too, but just decided otherwise. Wanted to work with people in the end. 
<span id="time-span">22:41:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you want to do later? And yeah I can understand that. 
<span id="time-span">22:41:40</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Just thinking about going to bed early, really. Do you have any plans? 
<span id="time-span">22:42:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sorry I meant, as a job, what you&#039;ll want to do later. There&#039;s plenty of different ways to go in education. 
<span id="time-span">22:44:23</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Oh! Counseling and care, most likely, especially for handicapped kids. What do you plan to do? 
<span id="time-span">22:45:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly research on the brain and neurons, and how we&#039;re able to learn. And that is pretty cool! 
<span id="time-span">22:46:18</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Yeah, I guess I am going into that from a different direction at the moment. How do we learn, but not about the mechanics, but the methods we use to learn. 
<span id="time-span">22:48:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That definitely sounds great. I wish you the best luck! 
<span id="time-span">22:48:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">22:49:03</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Aw damn, just wanted to ask something. 
<span id="time-span">22:49:14</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>And yeah, I guess I will stay with my earlier guess. 
<span id="time-span">22:49:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation? 
<span id="time-span">22:50:19</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>The human one. 
<span id="time-span">22:50:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">22:51:47</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>I&#039;d say a 6. 
<span id="time-span">22:51:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months. 
<span id="time-span">22:52:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now; Otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">22:53:57</span><span id="name-span">Tam</span>Any chance to hear which was which right now?
