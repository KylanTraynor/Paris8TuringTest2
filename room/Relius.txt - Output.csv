Moderator,0,0,"Hello Relius! ",14,
Moderator,2,2,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Relius,12,10,"Its no problem. ",16,
Moderator,21,9,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,29,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,40,11,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Relius,58,18,"Ok. ",4,
Moderator,60,2,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,66,6,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,72,6,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,83,11,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,90,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,96,6,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,102,6,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,108,6,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,115,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,124,9,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,130,6,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,136,6,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,143,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Relius,149,6,"I do. ",6,
Moderator,160,11,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready?  ",103,
Relius,168,8,"I am. ",6,
Andrew,176,8,"Hello! ",7,
Relius,181,5,"Hello! ",7,1
Andrew,187,6,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Relius,196,9,"Not bad, how about you? ",24,1
Andrew,214,18,"I&#039;m quite alright. What are you up to? ",44,1
Relius,239,25,"Nothing too interesting, just messing with friends. ",52,1
Andrew,273,34,"Sounds fun enough. I&#039;m not doing much myself right now. ",61,1
Relius,294,21,"Do you like any sports? ",24,1
Andrew,322,28,"Nah, I&#039;m not really a sports person. How about you? ",57,1
Relius,367,45,"I&#039;m not too much of one either. ",37,1
Andrew,388,21,"What kind of things do you like? ",33,1
Relius,433,45,"Books, games. I&#039;m more of an indoors person, more academic than sporty. ",77,1
Andrew,457,24,"I&#039;d be the same actually. Mind if I ask how old you are? ",62,1
Relius,474,17,"I&#039;m twenty, how old are you? ",34,1
Andrew,496,22,"Just one year older than you: 21. ",34,1
Relius,523,27,"What&#039;s your favorite book, show, game, etc.? ",50,1
Andrew,553,30,"I don&#039;t know if I have a favorite book or game, but I absolutely love Game of Thrones. ",92,1
Relius,563,10,"What do you love about it? ",27,1
Andrew,610,47,"How real the characters feel. They don&#039;t feel empty, or like filler characters. They all have their own stories. ",118,1
Relius,636,26,"Do you have a favorite character? ",34,1
Andrew,672,36,"It would have to be Tyrion yeah. You? ",38,1
Relius,697,25,"Not sure, I kinda fell out of watching it. ",43,1
Andrew,711,14,"Why? ",5,1
Relius,731,20,"Not sure why, life kinda got in the way... What foods do you like? ",67,1
Andrew,772,41,"Well, that&#039;s probably going to sound very generic, but I love pizza. Especially ones with chicken and ground beef. ",120,1
Relius,818,46,"Could you describe to me how it tastes? Like the consistency, the flavors, and how it smells? ",94,1
Andrew,901,83,"You mean in absolute? Or compared to other things. Because feelings are really not easy to describe in the absolute... It&#039;s like trying to explain what color is to someone who&#039;s blind. ",195,1
Relius,955,54,"Describe it however you best can. ",34,1
Andrew,1043,88,"Well, the crust is usually a bit crunchy, but it really depends on the type of pizza, the rest is much softer thanks to the tomato sauce and the cheese. ",153,1
Moderator,1088,45,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1100,12,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Relius,1159,59,"Well... all answers were reasonable, if a bit... easy to say. It could be either or. ",85,
Moderator,1197,38,"It&#039;s not your final answer, you&#039;ll be able to change it after the next conversation, but you still need to give one answer. ",134,
Relius,1233,36,"Mmmm... I&#039;ll say actual person. ",37,
Moderator,1259,26,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
Relius,1267,8,"I am. ",6,
Andrew,1273,6,"Hello! ",7,
Relius,1285,12,"Hello! How are you ",19,2
Andrew,1301,16,"I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? ",39,2
Relius,1329,28,"Not bad... May I ask what you look like? ",41,2
Andrew,1393,64,"Well, I&#039;m about 6&#039; tall, I have dark hair and dark eyes. Sure! ",73,2
Relius,1417,24,"What is your favorite memory? ",30,2
Andrew,1504,87,"I&#039;m actually not sure though. What is yours? That&#039;s a good question. ",79,2
Relius,1544,40,"Mine is an ancient one from when I lived in Ireland. Where are you from? ",73,2
Andrew,1625,81,"In a city called London in the Ontario. I still live there and I was born in Canada.  ",86,2
Relius,1697,72,"Could you tell me what you think is the most striking, most interesting thing there? What do you think defines the actual physical city? ",137,2
Andrew,1752,55,"Only the university is worth checking out. There&#039;s nothing much here to be honest. ",88,2
Relius,1781,29,"Do you study or work at the university? What do you do there? ",62,2
Andrew,1815,34,"I&#039;m in summer break right now, but I study biology. ",57,2
Relius,1837,22,"Why biology? What brought your interests there? ",48,2
Andrew,1900,63,"What makes us feel and think, mostly studying the brain really. ",64,2
Relius,1916,16,"What is your favorite food? ",28,2
Andrew,1996,80,"I know that&#039;s pretty generic, and it would have to be pizza. ",66,2
Relius,2021,25,"Could you describe to me how it tastes? Like the consistency, the flavors, and how it smells? ",94,2
Andrew,2135,114,"I&#039;m not really sure. That&#039;s a bit weird, but I guess I could. At least that&#039;s how I like it, rather soft in the middle and smelling spicy. ",154,2
Relius,2151,16,"Ask me a question. ",19,2
Moderator,2193,42,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2221,28,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Relius,2256,35,"Well, the answers were rather generic, anyone could have been talking. I&#039;m thinking the first one was an AI. ",114,
Moderator,2279,23,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Relius,-84046,-86325,"About a five. ",14,
Moderator,-84009,37,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Relius,-83998,11,"Thank you. ",11,
Moderator,-83993,5,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise you can now close this window. ",116,
Relius,-83959,34,"May I ask what the correct answer was? ",39,
Moderator,-83939,20,"If you don&#039;t have any comments I can tell you right now, otherwise I&#039;ll tell you after your comments. ",112,
Relius,-83820,119,"I think the first one was an AI, as I said, because everything was generic, anyone could have said it. And while I may have not asked all the right questions, the second one was more specific. ",193,
Relius,-83812,8,"I have no further comments than that. ",38,
Moderator,-83788,24,"Alright. The first one was actually the human. ",47,
Relius,-83741,47,"Well, thank you for letting participate in this experiment. Good bye. ",70,
Moderator,-83731,10,"Thank you very much for your help! ",35,
