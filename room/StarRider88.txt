<span id="time-span">23:51:54</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Hello. 
<span id="time-span">23:52:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome StarRider88 
<span id="time-span">23:52:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:52:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you can see this, please say Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:55:20</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:55:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Perfect. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:55:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:55:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:56:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:56:11</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>That sounds good. Are you the guy who sent me the link? 
<span id="time-span">23:56:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:56:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:56:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:56:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:56:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:57:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post at a time. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:58:05</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Yes I do. 
<span id="time-span">23:58:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:58:26</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">23:58:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:58:40</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Hi, Andrew. How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:58:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:59:18</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>I&#039;m doing great. I just got done playing Guitar Hero on the Wii. 
<span id="time-span">23:59:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh nice! I haven&#039;t played that in a very long while. 
<span id="time-span">00:00:05</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Oh really? I was playing Legends of Rock. Which song is your favorite on there? 
<span id="time-span">00:00:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I honestly don&#039;t remember any of them. I just remember that it was really hard. 
<span id="time-span">00:01:18</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>It&#039;s only hard if you choose to play on Hard. 
<span id="time-span">00:02:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I found it hard to do even on normal. But I never played it long enough to really learn the buttons. 
<span id="time-span">00:03:09</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Ah. Do you have a job? 
<span id="time-span">00:03:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Kind of. I&#039;m a student, but I work at a KFC to pay for tuition. 
<span id="time-span">00:04:36</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Haha KFC. I&#039;m also a student. What college to you go to if you don&#039;t mind me asking? 
<span id="time-span">00:05:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I study Biology at the University of Western, Ontario. 
<span id="time-span">00:05:25</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Oh nice. I don&#039;t really have a major yet. I go to Santa Rosa Junior College in California. 
<span id="time-span">00:06:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What would you like to study? 
<span id="time-span">00:07:35</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>I&#039;d probably like to study astrophysics and veterinary sciences. Only problem is that both involve lots of math. Also considering geology. 
<span id="time-span">00:08:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That sounds really awesome actually. I study biology and neurosciences. 
<span id="time-span">00:08:31</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Biology? Nice. When I was little I wanted to be a biologist. 
<span id="time-span">00:08:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds like you want to do everything. 
<span id="time-span">00:11:01</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Haha yeah. I&#039;m a huge science guy. My favorite subject is astronomy. I just love the universe and I want to know more about it. If only it didn&#039;t require so much math. 
<span id="time-span">00:12:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Many things in sciences require maths anyway, but it&#039;s true that astronomy might require more than others. I&#039;m not really an expert on the topic. 
<span id="time-span">00:12:44</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Yeah. By the way, can I ask you a question?  
<span id="time-span">00:12:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Of course! 
<span id="time-span">00:13:08</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Which letter of the English alphabet flies, sings, and stings? 
<span id="time-span">00:13:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">00:13:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">00:14:39</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>The human. 
<span id="time-span">00:15:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">00:16:24</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">00:16:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">00:17:21</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Hi, Andrew. How are you? 
<span id="time-span">00:17:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m alright thanks. You? 
<span id="time-span">00:18:33</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>I&#039;m doing great. Time expired in the last conversation before the actor could answer my question. 
<span id="time-span">00:18:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What was the question? 
<span id="time-span">00:19:18</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span> Which letter of the English alphabet flies, sings, and stings? 
<span id="time-span">00:19:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>B. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:07</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Wow. You&#039;re really good. I didn&#039;t think you could answer trick questions. 
<span id="time-span">00:20:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Why not? 
<span id="time-span">00:20:55</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>I don&#039;t know. Thought maybe a trick question could trip the AI up.  
<span id="time-span">00:21:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, I&#039;m not the AI so... 
<span id="time-span">00:22:09</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>I&#039;m going to take that with a grain of salt because for all I know, you&#039;re lying to me. Why would the actor give me the answer to the experiment? 
<span id="time-span">00:22:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Maybe to make it easier for you. 
<span id="time-span">00:23:37</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>I doubt it. That would ruin the experiment. Let&#039;s try this question. Which one is correct? &ldquo;Penguins flies&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Penguin flies&rdquo; 
<span id="time-span">00:23:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The second one. 
<span id="time-span">00:24:13</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Wrong. Neither is correct. Penguins don&#039;t fly. 
<span id="time-span">00:24:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s a good point. It was grammatically correct though. 
<span id="time-span">00:25:18</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Yes that&#039;s true. But that wasn&#039;t the answer to the trick question. 
<span id="time-span">00:26:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup. Doesn&#039;t mean I&#039;m an AI though. 
<span id="time-span">00:27:21</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Of course it doesn&#039;t. But here is another question. If God is all powerful and can do anything, can he create a boulder so heavy, that even he can&#039;t lift it? 
<span id="time-span">00:28:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>There is no valid answer to this. 
<span id="time-span">00:29:18</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Correct, because the question is a paradox. Anyway, enough with the trick questions. Let&#039;s learn about you. Do you have a job or go to school? 
<span id="time-span">00:29:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. I&#039;m a student and work at a KFC. 
<span id="time-span">00:30:49</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Cool. What kind of video games do you play, if you play any? 
<span id="time-span">00:31:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>ROGs and City Builders in general. 
<span id="time-span">00:31:55</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Cool. I&#039;ve never played either. So, do you remember anything we talked about in the previous conversation? 
<span id="time-span">00:32:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you mean? 
<span id="time-span">00:32:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">00:32:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">00:35:07</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>The AI. 
<span id="time-span">00:35:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">00:35:43</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>4.5 
<span id="time-span">00:36:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I only accept integer values. 4 or 5? 
<span id="time-span">00:36:29</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>4 
<span id="time-span">00:36:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">00:37:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise, you can close this window. 
<span id="time-span">00:39:16</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>I really enjoyed this experiment. The Andrew in the second conversation said that he wasn&#039;t the AI after I mentioned I thought an AI would trip up over a trick question. Now THAT tripped me up. Haha. 
<span id="time-span">00:39:27</span><span id="name-span">StarRider88</span>Overall, very enjoyable.  
<span id="time-span">00:39:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you. You can now close this window.
