Moderator,13,13,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,32,19,"If you can see this, please say Yes. ",37,
Soul,59,27,"yes ",4,
Soul,76,17,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,76,0,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,87,11,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,110,23,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,124,14,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,133,9,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,139,6,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,145,6,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,151,6,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,159,8,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,169,10,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,175,6,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,183,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,189,6,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,195,6,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,201,6,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,207,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Soul,212,5,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,217,5,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Soul,223,6,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,234,11,"Hello! ",7,
Soul,241,7,"Hey there ",10,1
Andrew,248,7,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Soul,257,9,"I&#039;m doing ok ",18,1
Andrew,273,16,"Cool. What are you up to? ",26,1
Soul,296,23,"Not much really, just heard about another attack in Paris ",58,1
Andrew,332,36,"Another one? Oh damn. ",22,1
Soul,360,28,"Yeah... what about you? how are you and what are you doing? ",60,1
Andrew,413,53,"I&#039;m playing a bit of Minecraft, trying to figure out what I want to do. I&#039;m alright though. ",102,1
Soul,490,77,"I only really play with friends on it so we tend to just do stuff together from mining to building ",99,1
Andrew,543,53,"Do you play with them on a private server or on a public one? And what do you like to build? ",93,1
Soul,603,60,"We play on a private one, what do you like to build? ",53,1
Andrew,703,100,"If you&#039;re asking me the question, I like to build medieval buildings. I meant you, what you like to build with your friends when you do. ",142,1
Soul,764,61,"I just let my friend come up with an idea and just help her gather stuff for it really, though if I had to pick something I enjoy making Pixel art mainly ",154,1
Andrew,808,44,"Pixel art can definitely be quite fun to do. I see. ",52,1
Soul,823,15,"What do you see? ",17,1
Andrew,884,61,"I see that you&#039;re not really into actual building. You help your friends build. ",85,1
Soul,945,61,"Well you&#039;ve got me there... I&#039;m not really that good at figuring out dimensions for making buildings look good so I just let them do it ",146,1
Andrew,1047,102,"After a while you get the proportions right. Training yourself to see good buildings in real life and in Minecraft helps. ",122,1
Soul,1066,19,"huh I guess so ",15,1
Andrew,1108,42,"Anyways, what are you up to tonight? ",37,1
Moderator,1145,37,"Time is up! ",12,
Soul,1146,1,"Playing paper mario thousand year door ",39,
Moderator,1160,14,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Soul,1178,18,"Artificial Intelligence  ",25,
Moderator,1186,8,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,

Andrew,1219,11,"Wow that&#039;s direct. ",24,2
Soul,1243,24,"you don&#039;t like it? If so sorry, that&#039;s just how I talk to my friends ",79,2
Andrew,1268,25,"No worries, I just didn&#039;t expect it. How are you... bitch? ",64,2
Soul,1298,30,"Im good bitch, what are you up to? ",35,2
Andrew,1333,35,"Not much really. Probably going to play a bit of Minecraft or something. What about you? ",89,2
Soul,1353,20,"I&#039;m playing Paper mario Thousand year door ",48,2
Andrew,1369,16,"I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard of that one. ",53,2
Soul,1392,23,"It&#039;s a game for the gamecube, a nintendo console that came out late 2000 ",78,2
Andrew,1465,73,"Yeah I know what the gamecube is. I didn&#039;t remember it was that &quot;young&quot; though. I expected it to be from before 2000. ",133,2
Soul,1541,76,"yeah but seriously Paper mario thousand year door is a great game, you should try it if you can ",96,2
Andrew,1569,28,"I don&#039;t have a gamecube unfortunately. ",44,2
Soul,1606,37,"what do you like to do one minecraft ",37,2
Andrew,1640,34,"I mostly build actually. People say that I&#039;m a good builder. ",66,2
Soul,1661,21,"ah cool got any tips for me? I&#039;m terrible at building ",59,2
Andrew,1709,48,"Try to get inspiration from real life building, and blockify them! That&#039;s what I do. ",90,2
Soul,1754,45,"I&#039;ve tried that and it just feels like Im taking something without permission ",83,2
Andrew,1784,30,"Why though? ",12,2
Soul,1799,15,"I dunno I just feel bad ",24,2
Andrew,1873,74,"If the buildings exist and look good, it&#039;s because they were made to be shown to everyone. Taking inspiration is not bad, it&#039;s not like the look of buildings is copyrighted or anything. ",196,2
Soul,1927,54,"I guess so...  ",15,2
Andrew,1952,25,"Anyways, if you don&#039;t build in Minecraft, what do you like to do? ",71,2
Soul,1974,22,"i mainly help my friends build stuff just gathering stuff for them ",67,2
Andrew,2032,58,"You sound like someone good to have by your side when you get on a huge project in survival then. ",98,2
Soul,2057,25,"Yeah i&#039;m pretty much the gather or hoarder hehe ",53,2
Andrew,2091,34,"I played with a friend who was like that. It was really nice. Especially since I hate doing that myself. ",105,2
Soul,2103,12,"Lazy butt! ",11,2
Moderator,2126,23,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2143,17,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the FIRST conversation? ",80,
Soul,2154,11,"Artificial intelligence ",24,
Moderator,2158,4,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Soul,2164,6,"5 ",2,
