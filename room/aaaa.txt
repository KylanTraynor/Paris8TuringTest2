<span id="time-span">23:36:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello aaaa 
<span id="time-span">23:36:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:36:32</span><span id="name-span">aaaa</span>how are you? 
<span id="time-span">23:36:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I&#039;m good thanks. 
<span id="time-span">23:36:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:36:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:38:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:38:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:38:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:38:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">23:39:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">23:39:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:39:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:39:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:39:36</span><span id="name-span">aaaa</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">23:39:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:39:59</span><span id="name-span">aaaa</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">23:40:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello!
