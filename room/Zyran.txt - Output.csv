Moderator,5,5,"Welcome Zyran. ",15,
Moderator,10,5,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,45,35,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,52,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,63,11,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,70,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,80,10,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,90,10,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,96,6,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,103,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,111,8,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,119,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,129,10,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,137,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,144,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,155,11,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,162,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,169,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Zyran,175,6,"I guess so.  ",13,
Moderator,183,8,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Zyran,190,7,"Yep ",4,
Andrew,201,11,"Hello! ",7,
Zyran,207,6,"Hi ",3,1
Andrew,214,7,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Zyran,234,20,"I&#039;m good :-) Who is supposed to be leading the conversation during this test? :-)  ",88,1
Moderator,249,15,"[Please don&#039;t use smileys] ",32,1
Andrew,273,24,"Well, no one has to lead actually. We can just chat. ",53,1
Zyran,295,22,"Okay, then. And how are you doing?  ",36,1
Andrew,315,20,"I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What about you? ",53,1
Zyran,338,23,"As I&#039;ve said, I&#039;m good.  ",35,1
Andrew,365,27,"Oh yeah sorry I got distracted. What&#039;s up though? ",55,1
Zyran,403,38,"Nothing much, my brother sent this to me like 5 minutes ago. Guess I&#039;m just killing my time here.  ",104,1
Andrew,424,21,"Ah I see. You you play video games? ",36,1
Zyran,449,25,"I do, name me a few that you&#039;ve played lately, if you do too . ",68,1
Andrew,496,47,"Lately I&#039;ve been playing a lot of Mass Effect. I mostly play Minecraft. ",77,1
Zyran,536,40,"Yeah, I&#039;ve already played through the whole new Mass Effect that just came out. I&#039;m a videogame reviewer.  ",117,1
Andrew,590,54,"What did you think about it? And that&#039;s quite cool. ",57,1
Zyran,645,55,"Not bad, not awesome. Gave it 7/10. Slighty above average.  ",60,1
Andrew,699,54,"It&#039;s always hard to start a new series. I think it&#039;s not a bad start to a new trilogy to be honest. ",110,1
Zyran,763,64,"Yeah, the ending talked to me into giving it a 7. Otherwise, I&#039;d just give it a 6. What time did we start this test, do you know?  ",136,1
Andrew,797,34,"No I have no idea sorry. What did you like about the ending? ",61,1
Zyran,898,101,"The atmosphere. But let&#039;s change the subject. I wanna know if you&#039;re a bot or a human actually.  ",107,1
Andrew,920,22,"I&#039;m a human obviously. ",28,1
Zyran,939,19,"That&#039;s what a robot would say, as well.  ",46,1
Andrew,968,29,"It would be dumb to say that I&#039;m a bot though. But probably yes. ",70,1
Zyran,1019,51,"Unless you were a human and you would want to confuse me. That way you would say that you are a bot.  ",102,1
Andrew,1059,40,"I&#039;m supposed to convince you that I&#039;m the human, not confuse you. Mind you the bot would say the same since we have the same goal. ",141,1
Moderator,1076,17,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1089,13,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Zyran,1127,38,"Human ",6,
Moderator,1133,6,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
Zyran,1147,14,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1154,7,"Hello! ",7,
Zyran,1172,18,"Oh you again!  ",15,2
Andrew,1187,15,"I could say the same! ",22,2
Zyran,1209,22,"And you can!  ",14,2
Andrew,1220,11,"How are you? ",13,2
Zyran,1240,20,"Crap, ruined the joke... I&#039;m doing alright, how about you?  ",65,2
Andrew,1290,50,"I&#039;m quite alright! What joke did you have planned though? ",63,2
Zyran,1334,44,"Nevermind. So, if there are actual humans in this test. How many of actual real beings are there?  ",99,2
Andrew,1363,29,"Technically there&#039;s 3. You, me and the moderator. ",55,2
Zyran,1422,59,"I know, but there obviously has to be a team of people. If one Andrew is supposed to be a real human, then there has to be a lot of people taking shifts for the real Andrew.  ",175,2
Andrew,1494,72,"Nope, I&#039;m actually the only Andrew around. No replacements. ",65,2
Zyran,1578,84,"And how many people are acting as the real Andrew? If we put aside our little conversation here, I&#039;m just curious about the project.  ",139,2
Andrew,1623,45,"Well I just told you. I&#039;m the only one. ",45,2
Zyran,1694,71,"And if, for example, 5 other people would be taking the test and they just finished talking to the robot Andrew, they are supposed to wait in line for the real one?  ",166,2
Andrew,1722,28,"Yes. That&#039;s why we&#039;re only having one person at a time. ",66,2
Zyran,1737,15,"Oh I didn&#039;t know that.  ",29,2
Andrew,1752,15,"Well now you do. ",17,2
Zyran,1768,16,"How long are you doing this?  ",30,2
Andrew,1809,41,"Until we&#039;ve got enough data. I&#039;m not sure yet how long it will take. ",79,2
Zyran,1847,38,"Is this well-knows, this project? Never heard of it.  ",54,2
Andrew,1873,26,"Wait what? ",11,2
Zyran,1912,39,"Yeah, my brother sent this to me, but I&#039;ve never heard of it before.  ",75,2
Andrew,1925,13,"Why would you have heard of it? ",32,2
Zyran,2012,87,"So are you surprised I haven&#039;t heard of it or surprised that I thought I should have heard of it?  ",104,2
Andrew,2058,46,"No I misunderstood your first question. I now understand that you meant well known. And no it&#039;s not public, so there is no way you would have heard about it. ",163,2
Moderator,2078,20,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2093,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Zyran,2096,3,"Robot ",6,
Zyran,2101,5,"wait ",5,
Zyran,2111,10,"First conversation - human ",27,
Moderator,2116,5,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Zyran,2156,40,"Can I remake my answer? ",24,
Moderator,2162,6,"Yes ",4,
Zyran,2173,11,"Human (first conversation) ",27,
Moderator,2182,9,"I understood that yes. ",23,
Zyran,2194,12,"6 ",2,
Moderator,2203,9,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,
Moderator,2219,16,"If you have comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window. ",112,
Zyran,2288,69,"When am I gonna know who was the robot ? In those coming months? ",65,
Moderator,2313,25,"You can know now if you have no comment, or after your comments. ",65,
Zyran,2331,18,"Ok, I&#039;d like to know.  ",28,
Moderator,2343,12,"The human was the second one. ",30,
Zyran,2357,14,"Wow ",4,
Zyran,2396,39,"Ok then, goodbye and good luck with the project ",48,
Moderator,2415,19,"Thank you very much! Good bye and good luck with yours. ",56,
