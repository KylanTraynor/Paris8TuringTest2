<span id="time-span">23:24:38</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">23:24:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Cyrus! 
<span id="time-span">23:24:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:25:14</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">23:25:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:25:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:25:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:25:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">23:26:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:27:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:27:30</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:27:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready?  
<span id="time-span">23:27:43</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:27:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:28:00</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Hello. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:28:16</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>I&#039;m fine thanks, yourself? 
<span id="time-span">23:28:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:28:42</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Not much really, you? 
<span id="time-span">23:29:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Honestly, pretty much the same. Playing a bit of Minecraft but that&#039;s about it. 
<span id="time-span">23:29:38</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>I haven&#039;t played Minecraft in years 
<span id="time-span">23:30:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve only been playing it for a couple of years myself. I&#039;m kinda addicted to it. 
<span id="time-span">23:30:36</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Why do you like it? 
<span id="time-span">23:30:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly for building and socializing. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:07</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>So you play online? 
<span id="time-span">23:31:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. Single player is way too boring. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:38</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>That might be why I never enjoyed it. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Probably yes. You never tried playing online? 
<span id="time-span">23:33:02</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Only once or twice, but only with two other people. 
<span id="time-span">23:33:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. I actually own a server, so it helps meeting people 
<span id="time-span">23:33:46</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>How often do you play?# 
<span id="time-span">23:34:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Almost every day, but it depends. 
<span id="time-span">23:34:27</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>On what? 
<span id="time-span">23:35:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It depends on how much work I have to do, or how busy I am with other things in general. 
<span id="time-span">23:35:32</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>What sort of things? 
<span id="time-span">23:35:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Homework, mostly. 
<span id="time-span">23:36:20</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Do you have any tests coming up? 
<span id="time-span">23:36:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No, I&#039;m done for this year. I&#039;m in summer break now. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:37:07</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>I haven&#039;t taken a test in years. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you do now? 
<span id="time-span">23:37:49</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Work 
<span id="time-span">23:37:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of work? 
<span id="time-span">23:38:29</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Finance work 
<span id="time-span">23:38:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh, that sounds quite serious indeed! 
<span id="time-span">23:38:55</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>It&#039;s not, it&#039;s a load of wank. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ah ok then. I study biology, I was in my 3rd year. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:35</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>How many years is the course? 
<span id="time-span">23:41:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>4, and then I have to write a master thesis. 
<span id="time-span">23:41:32</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Any idea what you&#039;ll write it on? 
<span id="time-span">23:42:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I have a couple ideas yes. Mostly about the brain and learning. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:45</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Why that? 
<span id="time-span">23:43:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:43:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">23:43:24</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>AI 
<span id="time-span">23:43:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:43:44</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:43:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:44:01</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Hej 
<span id="time-span">23:44:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:28</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Good, you? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite alright thanks. 
<span id="time-span">23:44:53</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:45:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nothing much really. 
<span id="time-span">23:45:16</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>That sounds a little boring. 
<span id="time-span">23:45:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah it is. You? 
<span id="time-span">23:45:43</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>I&#039;m playing Fallout 4 
<span id="time-span">23:46:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never played it. 
<span id="time-span">23:46:30</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>It&#039;s about synthetic humans replacing real ones. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh really? I hadn&#039;t heard about that. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:50</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>It&#039;s interesting to see the reactions of everyday people to the idea of being replaced by an AI 
<span id="time-span">23:48:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I might have to play that. 
<span id="time-span">23:48:56</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>You should, it&#039;s like Blade Runner 
<span id="time-span">23:49:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Something else I&#039;ve never played! 
<span id="time-span">23:49:18</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>It&#039;s not a game. 
<span id="time-span">23:49:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh, well I&#039;ve never heard of it. 
<span id="time-span">23:50:11</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>So you&#039;re not familiar with the Voight-Kampff test? 
<span id="time-span">23:50:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That doesn&#039;t ring any bells no. 
<span id="time-span">23:51:26</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>It&#039;s the test used to distinguish Androids from Humans 
<span id="time-span">23:52:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I heard about the Turing Test, but not about that one. 
<span id="time-span">23:52:37</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>The Turing test is real, the Voight-Kampff is fictional. 
<span id="time-span">23:52:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Probably why I didn&#039;t hear about it then. 
<span id="time-span">23:53:45</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>What&#039;s your last name Andrew? 
<span id="time-span">23:54:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hook. 
<span id="time-span">23:54:34</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Andrew Hook 
<span id="time-span">23:54:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup that&#039;s correct. 
<span id="time-span">23:55:13</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>It&#039;s a nice name. 
<span id="time-span">23:55:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Thank you! Mind if I ask yours? 
<span id="time-span">23:56:06</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Cyrus Klein 
<span id="time-span">23:56:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s a very nice name too. 
<span id="time-span">23:56:50</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Thank you. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you like video games? 
<span id="time-span">23:57:31</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>I do. 
<span id="time-span">23:57:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I mean, other than fallout? 
<span id="time-span">23:58:09</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">23:58:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I play a lot of Minecraft. And I&#039;ve recently finished Mass Effect. 
<span id="time-span">23:59:02</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>Which one? 
<span id="time-span">23:59:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:59:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">00:00:01</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>AI 
<span id="time-span">00:00:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">00:00:40</span><span id="name-span">Cyrus</span>2 
<span id="time-span">00:00:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.
