<span id="time-span">05:39:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Azelle. 
<span id="time-span">05:39:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study! 
<span id="time-span">05:39:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">05:40:24</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">05:40:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">05:40:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">05:41:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">05:41:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">05:41:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">05:41:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">05:41:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">05:42:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">05:42:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">05:42:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">05:42:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">05:42:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">05:42:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">05:42:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">05:42:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">05:43:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">05:43:23</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Yes.  Talk to each of them, type [STOP] when I have made my choice. 
<span id="time-span">05:43:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">05:43:50</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">05:44:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">05:44:15</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Hello.  How are you today? 
<span id="time-span">05:44:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite alright. You? 
<span id="time-span">05:44:49</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>I&#039;m okay.  Tell me, what are your favorite hobbies? 
<span id="time-span">05:45:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I love video games mostly. 
<span id="time-span">05:45:30</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Oh?  What are you favorite games? 
<span id="time-span">05:46:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Minecraft. I play way too much of it. 
<span id="time-span">05:46:30</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>How long have you played it? 
<span id="time-span">05:47:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>About 2 years. 
<span id="time-span">05:47:42</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Ah.  I played it way back when maps weren&#039;t infinite. 
<span id="time-span">05:48:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Are you still playing it? 
<span id="time-span">05:48:20</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>I haven&#039;t played it in a while.  I couldn&#039;t get the hang of doing some of the redstone stuff.  Just seemed tedious. 
<span id="time-span">05:48:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s quite interesting to do though. 
<span id="time-span">05:49:07</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>What have you made with redstone, if anything? 
<span id="time-span">05:49:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I made a functional clock once. 
<span id="time-span">05:50:04</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>That must have taken quite a lot of time, huh? 
<span id="time-span">05:50:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah, it wasn&#039;t easy to do. 
<span id="time-span">05:50:50</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Do you play any other games? 
<span id="time-span">05:51:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I finished the last Mass Effect a month ago. 
<span id="time-span">05:52:28</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Which one was that? 
<span id="time-span">05:52:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Andromeda. 
<span id="time-span">05:53:06</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>I could never get into the series.  That and I&#039;ve always heard the quality got worse and worse with each one. 
<span id="time-span">05:53:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s not quite true actually. 
<span id="time-span">05:53:49</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Oh?  Why do you say that? 
<span id="time-span">05:54:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I liked each episode more than the previous one. Except maybe for Andromeda. 
<span id="time-span">05:54:44</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Why not Andromeda? 
<span id="time-span">05:55:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The story wasn&#039;t as good as with the previous ones. 
<span id="time-span">05:55:38</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>What was the story about? 
<span id="time-span">05:55:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Settling a new galaxy. 
<span id="time-span">05:56:55</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>What was your favorite part about the game? 
<span id="time-span">05:57:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The gameplay was quite good, and a fresh start feels nice. 
<span id="time-span">05:58:16</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Have you played any other games from that developer? 
<span id="time-span">05:58:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I like Dragon Age too. 
<span id="time-span">05:58:58</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>I liked the first one. 
<span id="time-span">05:59:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">05:59:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">05:59:56</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>If I had to pick, the AI. 
<span id="time-span">06:00:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">06:00:12</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">06:00:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>hello! 
<span id="time-span">06:00:31</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Hello.  How are you? 
<span id="time-span">06:00:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">06:01:02</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>I&#039;m doing okay.  Where are you from? 
<span id="time-span">06:01:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m from Canada. I live in London. You? 
<span id="time-span">06:02:12</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Middle of the US.  How has the weather been? 
<span id="time-span">06:03:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>A bit cooler than the previous week, which isn&#039;t a bad thing actually. It was way too hot for me. 
<span id="time-span">06:03:58</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Yeah, I know that feeling.  What do you do for a living? 
<span id="time-span">06:04:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nothing at the moment. I&#039;m a student, and I just started summer break. 
<span id="time-span">06:05:07</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>What are you studying? 
<span id="time-span">06:05:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Biology. I was in my 3rd year. 
<span id="time-span">06:05:50</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>What do you plan to do after college? 
<span id="time-span">06:06:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hopefully research on the brain. Trying to figure out the biological basis of learning in particular. 
<span id="time-span">06:07:26</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Interesting.  As in, trying to determine how the brain actually &#039;learns&#039;? 
<span id="time-span">06:08:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. The different neural networks involved in learning fascinate me. 
<span id="time-span">06:09:20</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>What do you think would be possible if it was understood better? 
<span id="time-span">06:10:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It would certainly help us deal more efficiently with Alzheimer&#039;s disease for one. It might also help us simulate it and make more intelligent programs inspired by biology. 
<span id="time-span">06:11:29</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>how would it help with alzheimer&#039;s? 
<span id="time-span">06:13:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>People with Alzheimer&#039;s disease tend to forget about recent memories, but keep the older ones. Trying to figure out more about the way we learn might shed some light on why that&#039;s the case. 
<span id="time-span">06:14:31</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Is memory related to learning? 
<span id="time-span">06:14:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It would seem that it is yes. 
<span id="time-span">06:15:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">06:15:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">06:16:25</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>I think the first actor might be the actual person. 
<span id="time-span">06:16:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">06:16:49</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>Human 
<span id="time-span">06:17:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Sorry about that. 
<span id="time-span">06:17:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">06:17:15</span><span id="name-span">Azelle</span>4 
<span id="time-span">06:17:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">06:17:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.
