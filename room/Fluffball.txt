<span id="time-span">04:33:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Fluffball. 
<span id="time-span">04:34:05</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Hello fellow human! 
<span id="time-span">04:34:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">04:34:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">04:34:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">04:34:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">04:34:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">04:35:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">04:35:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">04:35:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">04:35:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">04:35:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">04:35:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">04:35:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">04:36:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">04:36:44</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>I do. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">04:37:06</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>I am. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:37:18</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Hello there! 
<span id="time-span">04:37:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">04:37:38</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>I&#039;m doing quite nicely myself, and you? 
<span id="time-span">04:37:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">04:38:18</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Well, at the moment I&#039;m talking to you! 
<span id="time-span">04:38:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Fair enough! What kind of games do you like? 
<span id="time-span">04:40:07</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Oh, I&#039;m quite fond of Adventure games myself. Playing the new Zelda at the moment, and I&#039;m quite liking it? Have you played that one yet, my fellow human? 
<span id="time-span">04:40:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nah I haven&#039;t actually. I&#039;ve been more into Minecraft and Mass Effect lately. 
<span id="time-span">04:41:44</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Oh yes? I&#039;ve heard the new Mass Effect has some pretty bad animations, what&#039;s your stance on that? 
<span id="time-span">04:42:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>They&#039;ve fixed some of it in the latest patch, so there&#039;s hope! Mass Effect never had fantastic facial animations though. But they used to be better. 
<span id="time-span">04:45:03</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Yeah, I really liked the original trilogy! Everyone complained about 3&#039;s ending, but I still thought it was a solid game overall. My favorite class was the Adept in those games, how about you? 
<span id="time-span">04:46:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I liked the Sentinel. I think that&#039;s the name of the biotic one right? I&#039;m not sure anymore. But yeah, I didn&#039;t really like the original ending, but the Extended Cut DLC fixed most of the issues. 
<span id="time-span">04:48:52</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Have you played any of the Metal Gear games? V was a fantastic game, but kinda fell short in its plot compared to the ones that came before it . Really fun gameplay though!
<span id="time-span">04:49:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No I never have. I did hear they were great though yes. 
<span id="time-span">04:50:53</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Fair enough. To change the subject, have you seen the new Star Wars teaser? If so, what did you think of it? 
<span id="time-span">04:51:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Wait, there&#039;s a new Star Wars? 
<span id="time-span">04:51:37</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Sure is, new trailer just dropped! 
<span id="time-span">04:51:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Damn I&#039;ll have to check it out. 
<span id="time-span">04:52:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">04:52:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">04:53:01</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>I think this was the human. 
<span id="time-span">04:53:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">04:53:41</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>I&#039;m ready! 
<span id="time-span">04:53:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:54:04</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Hello my fellow human! 
<span id="time-span">04:54:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">04:54:32</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>I&#039;m doing absolutely wonderfully? What of yourself? 
<span id="time-span">04:54:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">04:55:04</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>At the moment I&#039;m talking to you! 
<span id="time-span">04:55:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Could be more exciting then! 
<span id="time-span">04:55:41</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Oh yes? How do you like to spend your free time? 
<span id="time-span">04:56:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly playing video games really. Like Minecraft and Mass Effect. 
<span id="time-span">04:56:43</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Good choices? What did you think about Mass Effect&#039;s weird animation controversy? 
<span id="time-span">04:57:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It was definitely deserved. The faces looked off most of the time, but the latest patch fixed some of it. So I guess there is some hope! 
<span id="time-span">04:59:14</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Fair enough! I&#039;ve been playing the new Zelda lately myself, what do you know about that one? 
<span id="time-span">04:59:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Pretty much nothing actually. On which console is it? 
<span id="time-span">05:00:47</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>The Nintendo Switch, just came out recently. Have you played many Nintendo games? 
<span id="time-span">05:01:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not really, except for Mario obviously. And Mario Kart on the Wii. 
<span id="time-span">05:02:11</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Which Mario did you play? Mario 64 was my first one. 
<span id="time-span">05:02:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I think it was mine too actually. Was it the one in 3D? 
<span id="time-span">05:03:12</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>It was the first one in 3D, so I guess! You play any other N64 games? 
<span id="time-span">05:04:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure, I was quite young at that time and I don&#039;t remember most of them. 
<span id="time-span">05:04:23</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Okay. Any classic films you&#039;re quite fond of? 
<span id="time-span">05:05:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I like Start Wars, The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter... and many others. 
<span id="time-span">05:06:18</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Star Wars is great! Remember who the father of Luke Skywalker is? 
<span id="time-span">05:06:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Of course, Anakin, or Darth Vader. 
<span id="time-span">05:07:31</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>Correct! And remember who he kills at the end of VI? 
<span id="time-span">05:08:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Who are you talking about? 
<span id="time-span">05:08:50</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>You know, the evil ruler of the galaxy! Remember his name? 
<span id="time-span">05:09:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">05:09:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">05:09:51</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>First conversation I still think was human. 
<span id="time-span">05:09:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">05:10:14</span><span id="name-span">Fluffball</span>6 
<span id="time-span">05:10:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.
