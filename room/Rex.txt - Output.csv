Moderator,0,0,"Welcome Rex. ",13,
Moderator,20,20,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,39,19,"If you can see this, please say &quot;yes&quot; ",48,
Rex,45,6,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,50,5,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,60,10,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,67,7,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,73,6,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,84,11,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,98,14,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,107,9,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,115,8,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,125,10,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,133,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,141,8,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,149,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,158,9,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,166,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,173,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,179,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Rex,190,11,"yes ",4,
Moderator,196,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Rex,210,14,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,214,4,"Hello! ",7,
Rex,236,22,"Hi there ",9,1
Andrew,243,7,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Rex,264,21,"I&#039;m doing well. How are you? ",34,1
Andrew,281,17,"I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks. What are you up to? ",57,1
Rex,319,38,"Not much. Just enjoying a quiet Saturday ",41,1
Andrew,350,31,"Sounds quite good. That&#039;s pretty much the same for me actually. ",69,1
Rex,410,60,"It&#039;s nice to enjoy some peace and quiet every now and then, isn&#039;t it? ",80,1
Andrew,461,51,"Yeah. Without the stress of having to work on something or running everywhere. Simply enjoying yourself watching TV or playing games. ",134,1
Rex,495,34,"Indeed. It&#039;s my favorite way to spend my time off ",55,1
Andrew,527,32,"Do you like video games? ",25,1
Rex,573,46,"I do, actually. They&#039;re my favorite pastime ",49,1
Andrew,589,16,"Which ones in particular? Or what kind of games? ",49,1
Rex,638,49,"I enjoy most genres. I&#039;ve recently started playing Halo again ",67,1
Andrew,680,42,"Oh yeah I played the first three ones a while ago in co-op. ",60,1
Rex,711,31,"That&#039;s cool. Which one is your favorite? ",46,1
Andrew,747,36,"I&#039;m not entirely sure. I&#039;d say the third one, but I never got to finish it. ",86,1
Rex,789,42,"Have you played any of the newer ones? ",39,1
Andrew,811,22,"Unfortunately no. I don&#039;t have a Xbox One. ",48,1
Rex,854,43,"Neither do I ",13,1
Andrew,894,40,"I&#039;ve watched a playthrough of the fourth on youtube though. ",65,1
Rex,960,66,"I didn&#039;t enjoy the fourth one very much. I haven&#039;t played the fifth, so I wouldn&#039;t know much about it ",117,1
Andrew,995,35,"What is it you didn&#039;t like in the fourth? ",47,1
Rex,1054,59,"The plot seemed pointless and the gameplay felt too generic. Overall just not very memorable ",93,1
Moderator,1142,88,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1156,14,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Rex,1172,16,"The A.I. ",9,
Moderator,1180,8,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,

Rex,1251,26,"I&#039;m doing well, and you? ",30,2
Andrew,1263,12,"I&#039;m doing quite alright. What are you up to? ",50,2
Rex,1291,28,"Just sitting around, enjoying my afternoon ",43,2
Andrew,1326,35,"Anything fun planned? ",22,2
Rex,1357,31,"Other than sleeping in, not really ",35,2
Andrew,1387,30,"Well, that&#039;s not bad. I could definitely use that. ",56,2
Rex,1430,43,"I&#039;m sure. Are you up to anything interesting? ",51,2
Andrew,1460,30,"Probably just going to play games actually. Do you play Minecraft? ",67,2
Rex,1487,27,"I used to, but not so much anymore ",35,2
Andrew,1506,19,"Why not? ",9,2
Rex,1545,39,"I felt that it got repetitive quickly. Ran out of things to do ",63,2
Andrew,1566,21,"Ah yeah that tends to happen unfortunately. ",44,2
Rex,1599,33,"Are there any other games you enjoy? ",37,2
Andrew,1640,41,"I only really play Minecraft, but lately I&#039;ve also been very much into Mass Effect. ",89,2
Rex,1673,33,"Have you played the newest one? ",32,2
Andrew,1700,27,"Yeah I have actually. ",22,2
Rex,1729,29,"Did you enjoy it? I&#039;ve heard good and bad things about it ",63,2
Andrew,1762,33,"I did yes. But it still deserves its reputation. It does have good and bad things. ",83,2
Rex,1801,39,"What did you enjoy most about it? ",34,2
Andrew,1829,28,"That&#039;s a good question actually. I&#039;m not entirely sure. ",66,2
Rex,1872,43,"What system do you play it on? ",31,2
Andrew,1904,32,"PC. That&#039;s where I play most of my games now. ",51,2
Rex,1950,46,"I&#039;ve been wanting to get a new PC, but I don&#039;t quite have the funds at the moment ",92,2
Andrew,2022,72,"Yeah they can be quite expensive. I think it&#039;s a really good idea if you want to enjoy plenty of nice games though. You don&#039;t need to get one that expensive to play the latest games on it. ",199,2
Rex,2104,82,"Yeah, but I&#039;d like one that can handle pretty much any game and still have them look great. Also, one that will last a while ",130,2
Andrew,2121,17,"Get a desktop computer then. ",29,2
Moderator,2129,8,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2149,20,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Rex,2175,26,"Human ",6,
Moderator,2182,7,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Rex,2190,8,"3 ",2,
