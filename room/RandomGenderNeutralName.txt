<span id="time-span">17:52:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello RandomGenderNeutralN. 
<span id="time-span">17:52:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:52:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">17:53:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">17:53:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">17:53:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">17:53:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">17:53:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">17:53:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">17:54:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">17:54:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">17:54:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">17:55:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">17:55:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">17:55:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">17:55:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">17:55:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">17:56:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">17:56:17</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Yes, I do understand. 
<span id="time-span">17:56:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">17:56:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">17:56:51</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Hi there, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">17:57:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">17:57:30</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Me as well, mind if I ask you some pretty random questions to see if you are the bot? 
<span id="time-span">17:57:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>As long as they are still intelligible for a human! 
<span id="time-span">17:58:08</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Is the following word spelled correct? &#039;&Kappa;night&#039; 
<span id="time-span">17:58:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>If you indeed want to talk about a guy in shining armor, yes. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:10</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Well, you kind of passed the first test, a Bot does not know that the capital greek Kappa looks exactly like the capital letter &#039;K&#039; in most stylesets, so yeah, I meant the guy in shining armor. Nice. 
<span id="time-span">18:00:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yay, I&#039;m not a bot. 
<span id="time-span">18:02:04</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>At least you don&#039;t look like one for now. Okay, next one. I will give you pairs of things that have a very obvious similarity. You will then find a fitting word to complete the last pair, ready? 
<span id="time-span">18:02:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m horrible at this, but go ahead. 
<span id="time-span">18:04:00</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>(Sky,Water) (Leaf,Grass) (Paper,The house the president works in) (sand,____) 
<span id="time-span">18:04:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup. I suck at this. Is it desert? 
<span id="time-span">18:05:13</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Well, why would it be desert? 
<span id="time-span">18:06:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh wait. Sky, water, that&#039;s blue, leaf, grass, that&#039;s green, paper, the house, that&#039;s white, for sand, I&#039;d just need something yellow. So sure desert. 
<span id="time-span">18:08:06</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Well, you are able to understand abstract relationships between words, I am pretty sure by now that you are a human or the best bot I ever had the joy to chat with. Well Andrew, can we chat about you?
<span id="time-span">18:08:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Only if we can chat about you too! What do you want to know? 
<span id="time-span">18:09:23</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Well, sure, lets just take turns in asking questions. Where are you from? don&#039;t need to be the town, just general region or so. 
<span id="time-span">18:09:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I live in London, Ontario right now. You? 
<span id="time-span">18:10:58</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>I am in Germany. I heard a lot about ontario, do you often pet the wild elephants there? 
<span id="time-span">18:11:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The pink ones yes! How often do you have beer? 
<span id="time-span">18:11:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">18:12:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">18:12:25</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>The Human 
<span id="time-span">18:12:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">18:13:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">18:13:14</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Hi there, nice to meet you. 
<span id="time-span">18:13:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nice to meet you too. How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">18:13:47</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Fine, thanks! Mind if I ask some questions? 
<span id="time-span">18:14:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sure, I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s why we&#039;re talking! 
<span id="time-span">18:14:37</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Is the following word spelled correctly? &#039;&Kappa;night&#039; 
<span id="time-span">18:15:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s right if you meant dragons food. 
<span id="time-span">18:16:10</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>At least you don&#039;t look like one for now. Okay, next one. I will give you pairs of things that have a very obvious similarity. You will then find a fitting word to complete the last pair, ready?  
<span id="time-span">18:16:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;m quite good at that. But shoot! 
<span id="time-span">18:16:49</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>(Sky,Water) (Leaf,Grass) (Paper,The house the president works in) (sand,____)  
<span id="time-span">18:17:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mmm. Sun? 
<span id="time-span">18:17:53</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Why would it be sun? 
<span id="time-span">18:18:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It seems to be fitting. 
<span id="time-span">18:18:37</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Can you name the thing your answear has in common with the prompt word? 
<span id="time-span">18:19:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m actually a bit confused right now. Wasn&#039;t it the good answer? 
<span id="time-span">18:20:45</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>There were many good answears, I am more interested in your abillity to defend your choice or give a reasoning for it. 
<span id="time-span">18:21:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. It just felt right honestly. 
<span id="time-span">18:22:10</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>so you do not see what these have in common? look at the third pair, it kind of gives it away as an example of the property is in the name of the structre. 
<span id="time-span">18:23:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I honestly don&#039;t. The first two pairs I think I see, but the rest not so much. 
<span id="time-span">18:23:58</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>I used a descriptio of a building, in the third pair, do you know the name of the building I am refering to? 
<span id="time-span">18:24:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Trump tower? 
<span id="time-span">18:25:40</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>that is where he lives, but where is his famous office in? I asked for where he works to rule out this option. 
<span id="time-span">18:26:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. The white house then. 
<span id="time-span">18:26:49</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>okay, what do the white house have in common with paper? 
<span id="time-span">18:27:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>They are both white. And if you&#039;re not careful enough they&#039;ll find a way to cut you. 
<span id="time-span">18:27:46</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>Well you are funny, but honestly, I do believe that you are the Bot by now. 
<span id="time-span">18:28:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>My feelings are hurt to be honest. 
<span id="time-span">18:28:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">18:28:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">18:28:48</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>The Human 
<span id="time-span">18:28:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how comfident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">18:29:11</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>7 
<span id="time-span">18:29:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.

<span id="time-span">18:30:27</span><span id="name-span">RandomGenderNeutralName</span>You guys wrote a awesome bot, I believe I got it right but you mimic human behaviour pretty well!
