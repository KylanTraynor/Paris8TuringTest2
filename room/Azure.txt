<span id="time-span">22:07:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Azure! 
<span id="time-span">22:08:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:08:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">22:08:42</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Okidoki 
<span id="time-span">22:08:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">22:08:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:32</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Sounds cool 
<span id="time-span">22:09:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">22:10:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">22:10:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">22:10:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">22:10:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">22:10:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">22:10:38</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Sure do. 
<span id="time-span">22:10:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">22:11:01</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Let&#039;s do it 
<span id="time-span">22:11:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">22:11:42</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>hey there 
<span id="time-span">22:11:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">22:12:02</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Eh, can&#039;t complain. Wouldn&#039;t do me any good to anyways, lol 
<span id="time-span">22:12:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, sometimes it feels good to rant a little bit! What are you up to today? 
<span id="time-span">22:13:27</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Doing some art for some friends. It&#039;s a surprise for them 
<span id="time-span">22:13:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s very nice! Is it a special occasion? 
<span id="time-span">22:14:21</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Nah, just some random gift art. I really like their fursonas and wanted to show it.  
<span id="time-span">22:14:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see! I take it you&#039;re a furry too? 
<span id="time-span">22:15:23</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Mhm. Sure am. Since 2010, at least. Well, that&#039;s when I first joined FA, lol 
<span id="time-span">22:16:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you go to the conventions and stuff? 
<span id="time-span">22:16:48</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Went to my first one this year, FWA. Do you know what that one is? 
<span id="time-span">22:17:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not actually a furry myself, I only have some very basic knowledge of all that. 
<span id="time-span">22:18:17</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Ah, well it&#039;s a con in Atlanta, Georgia.  It&#039;s really awesome 
<span id="time-span">22:18:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it something public? Or a private event where only furries can come? 
<span id="time-span">22:19:43</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Oh its public. It&#039;s held at the Marriot there. It&#039;s from Thursday to Sunday, and it was a blast.  
<span id="time-span">22:20:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nice! I&#039;ve never actually been to any convention. I&#039;ve been considering going to Minecon, but that&#039;s about it. 
<span id="time-span">22:20:54</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>You should. If nothing else, get some friends and just go and hang out. 
<span id="time-span">22:21:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>They tend to be in the US though. Are you American? 
<span id="time-span">22:22:13</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Sure am. Can you guess which state? I&#039;ll give you a hint: Think Tar Heels  
<span id="time-span">22:23:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mmm, Isn&#039;t that the name of a team of something? 
<span id="time-span">22:23:54</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>It is. Carolina Tarheels 
<span id="time-span">22:24:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Right. I&#039;m not a big sports person. 
<span id="time-span">22:24:54</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Me neither honestly. lol. But my family is, so I know the names of teams at least 
<span id="time-span">22:25:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Can you guess where I live if I tell you one of our teams is the London Knights? 
<span id="time-span">22:26:30</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Hmm, England? lol 
<span id="time-span">22:26:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nope. Canada! 
<span id="time-span">22:26:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">22:27:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">22:27:52</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>The person 
<span id="time-span">22:28:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready?

<span id="time-span">22:28:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello!

<span id="time-span">22:28:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">22:29:46</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Eeehhh, alright all in all. Just getting ready to take photos for my roommate 
<span id="time-span">22:30:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of photos? 
<span id="time-span">22:30:57</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Photos of him in his fursuit. We have some old buildings behind our house that work well. 
<span id="time-span">22:31:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh cool! So you both are furries? 
<span id="time-span">22:32:00</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Yups. So is our third roommate too. But he&#039;s at his boyfriend&#039;s in Raleigh 
<span id="time-span">22:32:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds like some fun times. 
<span id="time-span">22:32:55</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>It is. They&#039;re awesome friends 
<span id="time-span">22:33:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Since when do you all know each other? 
<span id="time-span">22:34:11</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Vito and Jo have known each other for a couple years now. I&#039;ve only known them since last September 
<span id="time-span">22:34:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Being the new guy is not always easy. 
<span id="time-span">22:35:28</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Definitely not. And I&#039;m already socially awkward, hehe. I get along with them, but still awkward with their friends. 
<span id="time-span">22:35:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Are their friends furries too? 
<span id="time-span">22:36:20</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>The one&#039;s I&#039;ve hung out with, yeah 
<span id="time-span">22:36:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Furries everywhere! hehe.

<span id="time-span">22:41:02</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Oh nice! That&#039;s cool. got a preferred drink? 
<span id="time-span">22:41:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t drink much alcohol actually. 
<span id="time-span">22:42:31</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Same honestly. Just a few times. I&#039;ve gotten so drunk I passed out on Vito&#039;s floor before, hehehe 
<span id="time-span">22:43:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You passed out only once? 
<span id="time-span">22:43:30</span><span id="name-span">Azure</span>Mhm. I usually just get loopy and stuff, hehehe. That time I was far gone.

<span id="time-span">22:44:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer?
