Moderator,0,0,"Welcome Floww. ",15,
Moderator,9,9,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,27,18,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Floww,30,3,"Yup! ",5,
Moderator,34,4,"Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",110,
Floww,40,6,"Sounds good ",12,
Moderator,49,9,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,55,6,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,61,6,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,68,7,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,76,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,83,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,90,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,100,10,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,107,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,124,17,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,131,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,138,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,146,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,153,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,162,9,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Floww,189,27,"I understand. Do I talk with the actors normally or do I do it with the intent of finding out who is human and robot? ",118,
Moderator,215,26,"It is up to you really. ",24,
Floww,227,12,"Sounds good! I&#039;m ready. ",29,
Moderator,234,7,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. ",87,
Andrew,261,27,"Hello! ",7,
Floww,277,16,"Hey Andrew! ",12,1
Andrew,286,9,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Floww,309,23,"I&#039;m doing good. Are you the human or the robot? ",53,1
Andrew,340,31,"I&#039;m the human, but do you think I would I tell you if I was the robot? ",76,1
Floww,391,51,"That&#039;d make this a lot easier, wouldn&#039;t it? Are you able to parse speling erors? ",91,1
Andrew,432,41,"You mean if I&#039;m still able to understand what you&#039;re saying when you fuck up spelling? Depends, but that one yes. ",124,1
Floww,484,52,"Do the human actors work with the study too? Or do they pair up two random humans with each other and substitute our names with Andrew? ",136,1
Andrew,513,29,"What? ",6,1
Floww,541,28,"We&#039;re here for a study right? ",35,1
Andrew,552,11,"You are I guess. ",17,1
Floww,559,7,"What are you here for? ",23,1
Andrew,579,20,"Talking to you. ",16,1
Floww,593,14,"You&#039;re participating in the study too aren&#039;t you? ",60,1
Andrew,615,22,"Well, I&#039;m Andrew. ",23,1
Floww,648,33,"Do the human actors work with the study too? Or do they pair up two random humans with each other and substitute our names with Andrew? ",136,1
Andrew,669,21,"I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re talking about man. ",54,1
Moderator,686,17,"[ You&#039;re not talking to the actor, you&#039;re talking to the character of Andrew ] ",89,1
Floww,714,28,"Andrew, what do you like to do? ",32,1
Andrew,745,31,"Video games mostly. I play way too much Minecraft. What about you? ",67,1
Floww,767,22,"Same. ",6,1
Andrew,779,12,"Oh really? What do you like to do in it? ",41,1
Floww,795,16,"Mine. ",6,1
Andrew,811,16,"Ah ok. No building or anything? ",32,1
Floww,826,15,"No. ",4,1
Andrew,853,27,"Ah. Well... ok. ",16,1
Floww,870,17,"Ok. ",4,1
Andrew,883,13,"So... what are you up to today? ",32,1
Floww,928,45,"[STOP] I&#039;d like to talk to the second actor please. Thank you Andrew! ",75,1
Moderator,941,13,"Conversation interrupted!  ",27,
Moderator,950,9,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Floww,1012,62,"I think I&#039;ve been talking to a human. Towards the end I tried to &quot;bore&quot; him, and I think being able to recognize when a conversation isn&#039;t going anywhere and changing the topic to something more- ",216,
Floww,1047,35,"general is a human concept. I don&#039;t think most AI robots would do that, and keep trying to circle the conversation around the dead topic.  ",144,
Moderator,1072,25,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
Floww,1091,19,"Yup! ",5,
Andrew,1101,10,"Hello! ",7,
Floww,1167,66,"Hey Andrew. You know, you open up the exact same way as the Andrew I spoke to before. Exclamation mark and everything. ",119,2
Andrew,1229,62,"Oh really? Well, I could say that it&#039;s cool, but I feel like that other Andrew might be copying me. ",105,2
Floww,1250,21,"That&#039;d be a bit hard to believe since you&#039;re the one going second... ",79,2
Andrew,1262,12,"Well... this time I am. ",24,2
Floww,1328,66,"So, wouldn&#039;t it be crazy if both of you were different AIs and this study is just to see which one is more believable? ",124,2
Andrew,1355,27,"Well I&#039;m not an AI, so I don&#039;t really see that happening. ",68,2
Floww,1388,33,"What&#039;s something that human Andrew would know that AI Andrew wouldn&#039;t? ",81,2
Andrew,1471,83,"Well.. I don&#039;t really know? That I&#039;m awesome and he&#039;s lame? ",75,2
Floww,1519,48,"Why would he be lame? You guys are both supposed to be the same person right? ",78,2
Andrew,1546,27,"I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m just pulling things out of my ass at this point. ",77,2
Floww,1641,95,"Hmm, the other Andrew swore too. Is that added in to make the conversation seem more &quot;human&quot;? I guess if I was a programmer I&#039;d try to sneak in something small like that here and there to throw people",215,2
Andrew,1686,45,"I probably would too yeah. It&#039;s not like it&#039;s hard to add. ",69,2
Floww,1801,115,"Hmm, this is pretty hard to guess. What personality is &quot;Andrew&quot; supposed to have anyway? ",99,2
Andrew,1841,40,"You&#039;re asking me? Well I don&#039;t really know how to define my personality... ",85,2
Floww,1907,66,"Three words. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen variants of that before. ",69,2
Andrew,1922,15,"How so? ",8,2
Floww,1978,56,"Am I changing the topic? ",25,2
Andrew,2000,22,"I&#039;m not sure. I&#039;m a bit confused right now. Are you? ",63,2
Floww,2046,46,"Hmm... what would you say is your earliest childhood memory? ",61,2
Moderator,2074,28,"Time is up! ",12,
Floww,2086,12,"Haha, okay. ",12,
Moderator,2088,2,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Floww,2098,10,"I think I was talking to the human. ",36,
Moderator,2110,12,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Floww,2125,15,"I&#039;d say 5. ",16,
Moderator,2144,19,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2159,15,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. ",107,
Floww,2170,11,"Do I get to know who the human was? ",36,
Moderator,2187,17,"After your comments, or if you have none I can tell you right now ",66,
Floww,2238,51,"I think both of them are pretty believable. The single thing that made me think #2 was a robot was he didn&#039;t know how to describe his personality. ",152,
Moderator,2270,32,"Alright! Is that it? ",21,
Floww,2298,28,"&quot;Andrew&quot; seems to be a decently sociable guy, and most people like to talk about themselves. I feel like it&#039;s a question that most people would get and be prepared for. ",184,
Floww,2299,1,"That&#039;s it! ",16,
Moderator,2317,18,"(I wouldn&#039;t be) ",21,
Moderator,2337,20,"But, the first conversation was with the human! ",48,
Floww,2409,72,"Haha. Well, the second one was really convincing too! I think the first one used Ah a few times too. ",101,
Moderator,2442,33,"Maybe! Thanks for your help anyway! ",36,
Floww,2474,32,"Thanks! ",8,
