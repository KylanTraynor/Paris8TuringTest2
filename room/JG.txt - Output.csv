Moderator,0,0,"Welcome JG ",11,
Moderator,19,19,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,32,13,"If you can read this, please say &quot;yes&quot; ",49,
JG,34,2,"Of course. ",11,
JG,39,5,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,43,4,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,51,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,59,8,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,65,6,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,75,10,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,82,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,89,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,96,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,103,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,109,6,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,120,11,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,128,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,136,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,144,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,154,10,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,162,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
JG,170,8,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,173,3,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,

Andrew,228,16,"I&#039;m doing quite alright too. What are you up to? ",54,1
JG,247,19,"I was about to start working on a college project. ",51,1
Andrew,264,17,"Oh? What is it about? ",22,1
JG,282,18,"It is about beach erosion along the North Carolina coastline. ",62,1

Andrew,479,53,"Getting to really choose what I want to do, finally. What about you, what was your favorite part? ",98,1

Andrew,560,29,"I take it you&#039;re American? ",32,1
JG,585,25,"I am an American, yes.  Born in North Carolina. ",48,1
Andrew,656,71,"Oh yeah I had forgotten that your project was about North Carolina. Somehow the football games gave away that you were American more than that... ",146,1
JG,682,26,"We do love our football, I played football in high school. ",59,1
Andrew,717,35,"I&#039;m not really that much into sports myself. ",50,1

Andrew,782,17,"Nope. I have absolutely no idea. ",33,1
JG,802,20,"What are your goals for the rest of your life, Andrew? ",55,1

JG,885,41,"I wish you the best of luck in that.  We are almost out off time I believe. ",76,1
Andrew,925,40,"Thank you very much, same for you. And yes I believe we might be, but I&#039;m not entirely sure. Likely under 5 minutes though. ",129,1
