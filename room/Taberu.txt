<span id="time-span">21:58:40</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>hello 
<span id="time-span">21:59:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Taberu! 
<span id="time-span">21:59:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:00:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you can see this, say Yes. 
<span id="time-span">22:00:17</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">22:00:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Perfect. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">22:00:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">22:00:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">22:00:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">22:01:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">22:01:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">22:01:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">22:01:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">22:01:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">22:02:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">22:02:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">22:02:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">22:02:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">22:02:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">22:02:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post at a time. 
<span id="time-span">22:02:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">22:03:00</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">22:03:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">22:03:29</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">22:03:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">22:03:40</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Heya! 
<span id="time-span">22:03:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you? 
<span id="time-span">22:03:52</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>not bad thanks, yourself? 
<span id="time-span">22:04:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite alright! 
<span id="time-span">22:04:15</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>What are you up two 
<span id="time-span">22:04:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Playing M inecraft probably.
<span id="time-span">22:05:06</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Built anything cool? 
<span id="time-span">22:05:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>A cathedral yeah. 
<span id="time-span">22:05:31</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Nice, what blocks did you use? 
<span id="time-span">22:05:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Stone bricks and green stained clay for the roof. 
<span id="time-span">22:06:13</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Sounds good, have you seen the latest snapshot? 
<span id="time-span">22:06:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure no. 
<span id="time-span">22:06:59</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Ah, they have added concrete to the game, it&#039;s like stained clay but a stronger colour 
<span id="time-span">22:07:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh yes I&#039;ve seen that. 
<span id="time-span">22:07:59</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>They also added parrots as well 
<span id="time-span">22:08:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh? I didn&#039;t hear about that. 
<span id="time-span">22:08:54</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Yeah, they can sti on your shoulder 
<span id="time-span">22:09:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I was hoping they&#039;d add more wildlife. 
<span id="time-span">22:09:55</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>yeah, it&#039;s a nice addition, but I don&#039;t think they do anything like cats and dogs 
<span id="time-span">22:10:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s still nice to have birds. 
<span id="time-span">22:10:37</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>It is 
<span id="time-span">22:10:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you play Minecraft a lot? 
<span id="time-span">22:11:14</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>I get on when I can, but I&#039;m not making much progress right now  
<span id="time-span">22:11:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you like to do in it? 
<span id="time-span">22:12:08</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>I like digging, it&#039;s therapeutic. I can spend hours digging. 
<span id="time-span">22:12:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I hate gathering resources. 
<span id="time-span">22:13:45</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>It&#039;s annoying when you can&#039;t find something that you are looking for, but usually a good mining session is a good way to zone out and relax, put some music on and chill 
<span id="time-span">22:14:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>True. I usually just have others gather blocks while I build. 
<span id="time-span">22:15:18</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>I once managed to build a 9 by 9 automatic piston door in the side of a mountain 
<span id="time-span">22:16:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh nice! I made a working 4 quadrant clock tower once. 
<span id="time-span">22:16:27</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>What&#039;s that? 
<span id="time-span">22:16:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Like the London Tower. With a clock on the four sides. 
<span id="time-span">22:17:17</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>ah awesome, how long did that take 
<span id="time-span">22:17:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>A couple of days. 
<span id="time-span">22:18:26</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>was it working? or just aesthetic? 
<span id="time-span">22:18:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">22:19:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">22:19:23</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>AI 
<span id="time-span">22:19:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the second conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">22:20:29</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Ready 
<span id="time-span">22:20:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">22:20:39</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Good evening 
<span id="time-span">22:20:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">22:21:00</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>I&#039;m okay thanks. Hows the weather? 
<span id="time-span">22:21:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Quite windy. There might be a tornado coming toward us. 
<span id="time-span">22:21:46</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Oh dear, that doesn&#039;t sound good 
<span id="time-span">22:22:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. They are not sure it&#039;s going to reach us though. 
<span id="time-span">22:22:50</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Ah that&#039;s good then, Hopefully it doesn&#039;t cause too many issues 
<span id="time-span">22:23:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It should be alright. It&#039;s likely just a big storm. It hasn&#039;t been confirmed. 
<span id="time-span">22:23:58</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>What will you do in the mean time 
<span id="time-span">22:24:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Likely just play Minecraft honestly. 
<span id="time-span">22:24:34</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Ah fair enough 
<span id="time-span">22:24:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Do you play that game? 
<span id="time-span">22:25:01</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>I do, haven&#039;t done so in a while 
<span id="time-span">22:25:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mmm yeah. It can get old very fast without things to spice it up. 
<span id="time-span">22:26:22</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>It&#039;s mainly that I&#039;ve been playing on my friend&#039;s server, and if he isn&#039;t online then I can&#039;t play 
<span id="time-span">22:26:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. You might want to find a public server then, with your friend. 
<span id="time-span">22:27:17</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>I&#039;ve tried that but my PC lags out on public servers as there are too many people 
<span id="time-span">22:27:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s weird. It shouldn&#039;t be an issue. 
<span id="time-span">22:28:03</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>My laptop isn&#039;t very good sadly 
<span id="time-span">22:28:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Minecraft also tends to require a better PC than you&#039;d need for other good games. 
<span id="time-span">22:29:21</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Yeah, procedurally generated landscapes take it&#039;s toll on a processsor 
<span id="time-span">22:29:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I wonder how they managed to make it much faster on the C++ version. 
<span id="time-span">22:31:11</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>No idea, not too familiar with how C++ work. 
<span id="time-span">22:31:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not either yeah. What do you like to do in Minecraft when you can play it on your friend&#039;s server? 
<span id="time-span">22:32:54</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>I like digging, its therapeutic. But building is always fun, when I can figure out what to do 
<span id="time-span">22:33:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What was the most impressive thing you built? 
<span id="time-span">22:33:48</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>a 9x9 piston door leading down into a dwarven city. Sadly the city kind of stopped 
<span id="time-span">22:34:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh that sounds really nice. It&#039;s a shame that it&#039;s on hold. 
<span id="time-span">22:34:46</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Don&#039;t think I still have that save file though. 
<span id="time-span">22:35:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What other games do you play, if any? 
<span id="time-span">22:35:39</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>Undertale, played it through 4 times so far 
<span id="time-span">22:35:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">22:35:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">22:36:08</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>AI 
<span id="time-span">22:36:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">22:36:30</span><span id="name-span">Taberu</span>7 
<span id="time-span">22:36:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.
