Wade,0,0,"Hello! ",7,
Moderator,7,7,"Welcome Wade. ",14,
Wade,13,6,"Hi there! ",10,
Moderator,23,10,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Wade,31,8,"No problem! What&#039;s your major? ",36,
Moderator,74,43,"Psychology &amp; Human Cognition ",33,
Moderator,83,9,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Wade,100,17,"Oooh a game! How exciting! I&#039;m ready! ",43,
Moderator,103,3,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Wade,111,8,"Okay! ",6,
Moderator,113,2,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,121,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,133,12,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,141,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,153,12,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Wade,154,1,"Can he be named HAL? ",21,
Wade,167,13,"Sorry! Sorry, I&#039;ll be good. ",33,
Moderator,174,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,188,14,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,196,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,207,11,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,217,10,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,225,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,232,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,240,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,247,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Wade,258,11,"Yes I do. ",10,
Moderator,268,10,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Wade,296,28,"I am ready! ",12,
Andrew,299,3,"Hello! ",7,
Wade,307,8,"Hi there Andrew! ",17,1
Andrew,315,8,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Wade,333,18,"So far so good. It&#039;s my day off, so I&#039;ve been relaxing. How has your day been? Been up to much? ",106,1
Andrew,376,43,"I&#039;ve been alright too. Mostly playing games actually. ",59,1
Wade,398,22,"What kind of games do you like to play? ",40,1
Andrew,423,25,"Minecraft is the one I play the most. I&#039;ve also been enjoying Mass Effect for the last week. ",98,1
Wade,458,35,"I&#039;ve never played Mass Effect before. What game mechanics do you like the most? ",85,1
Andrew,490,32,"What do you mean? Specifically in Mass Effect or in general? ",61,1
Wade,507,17,"Specifically in Mass Effect. What do you like about the gameplay? ",66,1
Andrew,552,45,"I like how the plot depends on your choices and actions. It&#039;s not really gameplay, but the characters are also fantastic. ",127,1
Wade,600,48,"Do you prefer FPS or TPS? ",26,1
Andrew,655,55,"I&#039;m not a huge fan of shooter games in general, but I guess Mass Effect could be labeled as a TPS, so I&#039;ll say that. ",127,1
Wade,680,25,"What else do you do for fun? Any hobbies? ",42,1
Andrew,725,45,"I like reading, but I haven&#039;t been able to do that enough for a while actually. ",85,1
Wade,751,26,"What have you been up to besides reading? ",42,1
Andrew,785,34,"College work mostly. I study Biology. ",38,1
Wade,823,38,"What kind of biology is your passion? Human biology, marine biology, avian biology, something else? ",100,1
Andrew,866,43,"Neurology actually. That kinda goes across all of what you said. But more specifically human neurology. ",104,1
Wade,891,25,"I find the brain so complex. Do you think we&#039;ll ever fully understand the human mind? ",91,1
Andrew,927,36,"If we do, I doubt that it will be anytime soon. ",48,1
Wade,984,57,"How long have you been in school? ",34,1
Andrew,1040,56,"Well, I&#039;m in my 3rd year of university. So... yeah. ",57,1
Wade,1062,22,"What are your plans for the future? What would you like to do with your major? ",79,1
Andrew,1113,51,"I&#039;d like to do research. I want to figure out how neurons interact with each other and how we learn. ",106,1
Wade,1151,38,"I like to figure that out too. I&#039;m an Instructor, so I like to see how better I can teach my students. ",108,1
Andrew,1186,35,"There&#039;s quite a few studies that have been made about that actually. ",74,1
Wade,1209,23,"I know that. My mother was a school  psychologist, so I normally ask her for new information.",93,1
Moderator,1213,4,"Time is up! ",12,1
Wade,1231,18,"Is it bad that I was taking notes? ",35,1
Moderator,1250,19,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? (This is not your final answer) ",86,
Moderator,1256,6,"(It&#039;s fine) ",17,
Wade,1298,42,"It is hard to tell. I tried to slip the actor up, but I know good AI&#039;s are not put off by that. I&#039;m leaning toward AI, actually. ",139,
Moderator,1343,45,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",135,
Wade,1361,18,"I am ready. ",12,
Andrew,1380,19,"Hello! ",7,
Wade,1392,12,"Hi there! ",10,2
Andrew,1398,6,"How are you doing? ",19,2
Wade,1413,15,"I&#039;m alright. How are you? What all have you been up to today? ",67,2
Andrew,1445,32,"I&#039;m doing alright. I haven&#039;t been up to much really. Mostly just playing games. You? ",95,2
Wade,1489,44,"I&#039;m mostly watching Judge Judy. Is it odd that it helps me concentrate? ",77,2
Andrew,1521,32,"I can&#039;t tell, I&#039;ve never seen that actually. ",55,2
Wade,1561,40,"It&#039;s pretty fun. What sort of hobbies do you have? Any favorite types of games? ",85,2
Andrew,1613,52,"Yeah, I tend to spend my time playing Minecraft. and I&#039;ve been very much into Mass Effect for the last week or so. What about you? ",136,2
Wade,1653,40,"I play a ton of Warframe. Ever played that? It&#039;s super fun. ",65,2
Andrew,1676,23,"I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even ever heard about it no. What is it? ",70,2
Wade,1745,69,"It&#039;s a beautiful combination of hack-n-slash and TPS. I like TPS over FPS. What do you prefer? ",100,2
Andrew,1800,55,"I&#039;m not really sure. I haven&#039;t liked many FPS games, so I guess I like TPS more. ",91,2
Wade,1841,41,"What is it about TPS that makes you like it more? ",50,2
Andrew,1917,76,"I can&#039;t say I like it more specifically. But I do tend to like games that are in TPS. So I don&#039;t really know. ",120,2
Wade,1962,45,"How do you feel about AI? Will it ever sound like a human? ",59,2
Andrew,2037,75,"I don&#039;t know about sound, but I&#039;d say that we&#039;re getting closer about text at least. A good question might be : does it need to feel like a human? ",162,2
Wade,2065,28,"If the objective is to mimic humans, then I say yes. ",53,2
Andrew,2098,33,"Well yeah. If it&#039;s about being useful it&#039;s another topic entirely. ",77,2
Wade,2141,43,"I agree. Do you think robots will replace humans in the workforce? Is that a good thing? ",89,2
Andrew,2195,54,"I do, to some extent. Whether it&#039;s a good thing or not depends on if we&#039;re able to anticipate it enough by rethinking our societies. ",143,2
Wade,2255,60,"The human brain and societies is interesting to me, being an instructor. ",73,2
Moderator,2303,48,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2320,17,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Wade,2320,0,"I think I got this. ",20,
Wade,2330,10,"The first interaction was the AI. ",34,
Moderator,2342,12,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Wade,2363,21,"6 ",2,
Moderator,2368,5,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,

Moderator,2388,10,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window. ",116,
