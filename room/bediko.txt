<span id="time-span">20:09:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome bediko. 
<span id="time-span">20:09:24</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>Hi 
<span id="time-span">20:09:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:09:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">20:09:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">20:10:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:10:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">20:10:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">20:10:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">20:10:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">20:11:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">20:11:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">20:11:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">20:11:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">20:11:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">20:11:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">20:11:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">20:11:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">20:12:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">20:12:08</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">20:12:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">20:12:42</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">20:12:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello!

<span id="time-span">20:13:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. 
<span id="time-span">20:13:27</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>Cool. Where are you from? 
<span id="time-span">20:13:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m from Canada. You? 
<span id="time-span">20:13:48</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>Germany 
<span id="time-span">20:13:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh nice! 
<span id="time-span">20:15:02</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>So, are you only responding if I write something? 
<span id="time-span">20:15:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>We can only say one message each time. 
<span id="time-span">20:15:52</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>Mhhhh, but I am really bad at keeping conversations going on 
<span id="time-span">20:16:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">20:16:27</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>Not much, just chatting 
<span id="time-span">20:16:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Alright. It must be late in Germany. 
<span id="time-span">20:17:14</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>Yes, it is 8:17pm here 
<span id="time-span">20:18:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Alright. It&#039;s 2pm here.

<span id="time-span">20:19:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Which ones? 
<span id="time-span">20:19:57</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>World of Warcraft, Diablo 3, Hearthstone, Dark Souls, Skyrim, Minecraft, Tomb Raider, pretty much everything that could be fun 
<span id="time-span">20:20:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I haven&#039;t played most of those. Only Minecraft, Skyrim and Tomb Raider. 
<span id="time-span">20:21:00</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>Okay. How do I switch the actor? 
<span id="time-span">20:21:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted. 
<span id="time-span">20:21:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">20:21:52</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>I think it was the AI 
<span id="time-span">20:22:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the second conversation. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer.

<span id="time-span">20:25:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>There is a lot of interesting architecture. 
<span id="time-span">20:26:20</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>Could be

<span id="time-span">20:27:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never heard of it. Is it a small town? 
<span id="time-span">20:27:59</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>One of the big towns of the ruhr area 
<span id="time-span">20:28:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I really don&#039;t know much about Germany... What do you like to do? 
<span id="time-span">20:28:49</span><span id="name-span">bediko</span>I think I am done with this actor
