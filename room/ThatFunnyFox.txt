<span id="time-span">00:11:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome ThatFunnyFox! 
<span id="time-span">00:11:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:11:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">06:07:15</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>I am finally able! 
<span id="time-span">06:16:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good! 
<span id="time-span">06:16:32</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Better than good! 
<span id="time-span">06:17:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Let&#039;s get right to it then! 
<span id="time-span">06:17:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">06:17:17</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Roger 
<span id="time-span">06:17:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">06:17:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">06:17:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">06:18:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">06:18:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">06:18:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">06:18:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">06:18:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">06:19:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">06:19:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">06:19:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">06:19:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">06:19:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">06:19:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">06:19:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">06:20:15</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>So I&#039;m going to be having one conversation with an actor, and then after that a conversation with the other actor, yes? 
<span id="time-span">06:20:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>That is correct yes. 
<span id="time-span">06:20:51</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Does the second actor have any access to the answers/responses of the previous actor from the first conversation? 
<span id="time-span">06:21:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>No, but remember, they are trying to portray the same Andrew. 
<span id="time-span">06:22:11</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>I see!   Then I&#039;ll enjoy trying to tell them apart!  I believe I am ready to begin 
<span id="time-span">06:22:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">06:22:44</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">06:22:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">06:23:10</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Hello!  Tell me about yourself, Andrew 
<span id="time-span">06:24:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well that&#039;s pretty direct! I&#039;m a student in Biology, and I live in Canada. Is there anything specific you&#039;d like to know? 
<span id="time-span">06:26:04</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Well, considering the basis of this project, it&#039;d be interesting to hear how you came to be in this situation.  In other words, what brings a biology student from Canada, here? 
<span id="time-span">06:26:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m actually just helping a friend with his project. 
<span id="time-span">06:27:39</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>That makes sense.  Did you meet your friend in school, or somewhere else? 
<span id="time-span">06:28:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>We went to the same university for a bit yes. 
<span id="time-span">06:29:01</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>That implies you parted ways, at least for a bit. 
<span id="time-span">06:29:27</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span> That&#039;s right yes. 
<span id="time-span">06:29:53</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>How did that come to pass? 
<span id="time-span">06:30:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you mean exactly? 
<span id="time-span">06:30:40</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>If you both went to the same university, what happened that lead to your parting ways? 
<span id="time-span">06:31:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>He was an exchange student. I live here. 
<span id="time-span">06:32:01</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Oh I see.  And what made him think of you when it came to this project? 
<span id="time-span">06:32:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nothing specific, he just needed help really. 
<span id="time-span">06:33:47</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>He needed help but he reached out to someone living in another county who he just briefly went to the same University with?    
<span id="time-span">06:34:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure why that would be strange. 
<span id="time-span">06:36:20</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>It just seems to me like he should&#039;ve been able to find someone to help him who is in some way involved in his field of study, or lives in the same area, or whom he has a deeper relationship with.  
<span id="time-span">06:37:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I suppose he didn&#039;t find any. I can&#039;t really speak for him though. 
<span id="time-span">06:37:49</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>How do you feel about being a part of his project? 
<span id="time-span">06:38:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">06:38:32</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Darn.  Sneaky, sneaky... Okay I&#039;m ready for round two! 
<span id="time-span">06:38:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">06:39:02</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>I believe this was an AI 
<span id="time-span">06:39:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">06:39:19</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">06:39:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">06:40:06</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Hello Andrew!  Do you prefer surface-level, impersonal questions, or do you mind if I ask about more personal things regarding your thoughts and feelings? 
<span id="time-span">06:40:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, it&#039;s up to you really. I don&#039;t mind either way. 
<span id="time-span">06:41:37</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>What made you decide to help out the project moderator with this endeavor? 
<span id="time-span">06:43:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Curiosity mostly. I want to see if they can simulate the way our brain works. What interested you? 
<span id="time-span">06:44:32</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>I enjoy intellectual challenges, and consider myself rather perceptive.  The opportunity to test myself this way was an opportunity to me.  It will be shameful if I fail to get things right! 
<span id="time-span">06:45:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s not a bad reason yeah. Do you mind if I ask how old you are? 
<span id="time-span">06:46:21</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>I&#039;m thirty, and I worry about getting old.  Do you ever wish you could be young again, maybe redo certain parts of your history? 
<span id="time-span">06:47:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, technically I&#039;m still young. I&#039;m 21. I don&#039;t really think being 30 is that old either mind you, but yes, I think everyone feels that way to some extent. 
<span id="time-span">06:48:39</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>If you could reverse time somehow and go back in history to when you were younger, but keeping all the knowledge and skills you have with you now, what age/year would you go back to, and why? 
<span id="time-span">06:50:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Probably to when I was 16, when my parents divorced. 
<span id="time-span">06:50:13</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Why then?  What would you do differently? 
<span id="time-span">06:50:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure I&#039;d have done anything differently, but I might have seen things differently. 
<span id="time-span">06:52:01</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>I suppose that&#039;s true.  It would put things in perspective for sure.  You&#039;d know the world goes on. 
<span id="time-span">06:52:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. How about you? When would go back to? 
<span id="time-span">06:53:15</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>I&#039;d go back as far as possible without being an infant, to capitalize on all my knowledge of future events, and make a fortune!  It was nice talking to you Andrew.  [Stop] 
<span id="time-span">06:53:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">06:53:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">06:54:06</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>I feel like I am being tricked, but I think the first conversation actor was the AI 
<span id="time-span">06:54:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">06:54:43</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>5 
<span id="time-span">06:54:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">06:55:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. 
<span id="time-span">06:55:47</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Aww, you&#039;re not going to tell me?  What a shame...    
<span id="time-span">06:56:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can tell you after your comments, or right now if you don&#039;t have any. 
<span id="time-span">06:56:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I&#039;d just like to know what your thoughts are before actually knowing the answer. 
<span id="time-span">06:57:12</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Well I think in the first conversation, the responses tended to be brief and succinct, and there was a habit of confirming after the response.  &quot;Thats right yes&quot; &quot;we went to the same university yes&quot; 
<span id="time-span">06:57:58</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>so that&#039;s sort of making me think it was the AI, while in the second conversation the tone was more... what I&#039;d call organic or casual, and tended to include questions for myself, as well as addition 
<span id="time-span">06:58:19</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>additional information.   
<span id="time-span">06:58:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I see. 
<span id="time-span">06:58:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Is that all? 
<span id="time-span">06:58:53</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>That&#039;s pretty much the extent of my insight, yeah.  The second actor seemed to have more emotional and human responses, in my opinion. 
<span id="time-span">06:59:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Very well. In your case, the first conversation was indeed the AI. 
<span id="time-span">07:00:09</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Oh I&#039;m gonna rub this in Noel&#039;s face so hard~ 
<span id="time-span">07:00:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>What was his username? 
<span id="time-span">07:00:54</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>This was a great amount of fun! 
<span id="time-span">07:01:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Actually you probably don&#039;t know that. Let me see. 
<span id="time-span">07:01:14</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Hmm... I&#039;m not sure what his user name is 
<span id="time-span">07:01:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I&#039;m glad that you enjoyed it though! 
<span id="time-span">07:01:49</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>Well I wish you luck in creating the perfect AI to overthrow the human governments! 
<span id="time-span">07:01:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yeah, you did not talk to the same AI. 
<span id="time-span">07:02:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Ahah thank you! 
<span id="time-span">07:02:07</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>oh wow you have multiple AIs!  I didn&#039;t know that either.  Cool 
<span id="time-span">07:02:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We are testing different parameters yes, and trying to figure out which ones are the most visible. 
<span id="time-span">07:03:26</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>That&#039;s great.  It&#039;s a really interesting field, and if I knew the slightest bit about such technical things other than &#039;it&#039;s really cool&#039;, I&#039;d ask you a whole bunch of questions.  However, philistine 
<span id="time-span">07:03:37</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>that I am, I&#039;m just going to wish you good luck and thank you for letting me participate in this. 
<span id="time-span">07:04:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you very much for your interest! Your participation helped a lot. 
<span id="time-span">07:04:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You can close this window whenever you want. 
<span id="time-span">07:04:30</span><span id="name-span">ThatFunnyFox</span>thank you
