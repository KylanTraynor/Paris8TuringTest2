Maxmax,0,0,"Hello ",6,
Moderator,4,4,"Welcome Maxmax ",15,
Maxmax,12,8,"Thank you ",10,
Moderator,15,3,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Maxmax,20,5,"Nice to help ",13,
Moderator,23,3,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,32,9,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,43,11,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Maxmax,43,0,"Much appreciated ",17,
Moderator,53,10,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,64,11,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,72,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,82,10,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,94,12,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,102,8,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,111,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,122,11,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,130,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Maxmax,139,9,"Cool project. ",14,
Moderator,140,1,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,151,11,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,160,9,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,168,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Maxmax,181,13,"I do, quite simple but effective ones ",38,
Moderator,192,11,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Maxmax,202,10,"Yep ",4,
Andrew,209,7,"Hello! ",7,
Maxmax,215,6,"Hello there! ",13,1
Andrew,222,7,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Maxmax,238,16,"I&#039;m quite okay, what about you? ",37,1
Andrew,257,19,"I&#039;m doing alright too thanks. What are you up to today? ",61,1
Maxmax,290,33,"Not much. Writing a few commissions, and after that playing Warhammer.  ",72,1
Andrew,331,41,"I&#039;ve never played this game. I&#039;ve heard of it though. What kind of commissions are you writing? ",106,1
Maxmax,408,77,"Oh, I&#039;ve a few on work right now. Some fan fictions, and some others for friends. I like to write stories with the right idea. And about Warhammer, it&#039;s a strategic turn based game. Pretty nice. ",205,1
Andrew,487,79,"Oh I see, that sounds very cool, I&#039;m not much of a writer myself. Is Warhammer kind of like Age of Empires then? I liked those games. ",139,1
Maxmax,543,56,"Oh no no. It&#039;s a tabletop game, with dice and all. And awesome! Who did you like to use in Age of Empires? ",112,1
Andrew,607,64,"Oh ok! To be honest I don&#039;t remember that game enough to answer you. I played it a while ago. ",99,1
Maxmax,642,35,"Oh, I see. Any game that you played lately? ",44,1
Andrew,676,34,"I often play Minecraft, and I&#039;ve been really into the new Mass Effect lately. ",83,1
Maxmax,724,48,"Minecraft is awesome. I heard that the new Mass Effect isn&#039;t worthy the time. It&#039;s noting like the old trilogy ",121,1
Andrew,775,51,"I think it was pretty good overall actually. But it had some very annoying glitches and bad animations. They are slowly fixing all of that though. ",147,1
Maxmax,829,54,"After five years where I craved the game I was hoping for more. Who did you date back to the old trilogy? ",106,1
Andrew,892,63,"Yeah I know what you mean. I dated multiple characters actually. Who did you date? ",83,1
Maxmax,957,65,"Who was your favourite among them? And for me it was Liara. She was the best mechanic. ",87,1
Andrew,1011,54,"I really loved Tali. She was adorable in her own way, and very sensible. I liked Liara too though, and Garrus. ",111,1
Maxmax,1076,65,"Ahah. I did like Tali myself. I hated Ashley and Miranda. Garrus was the best friend I wished to have.  ",104,1
Andrew,1117,41,"I didn&#039;t like Miranda at first, but as I got to know her I started to like her more. ",90,1
Moderator,1127,10,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1152,25,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Maxmax,1153,1,"Oki. Nice chat about old games anyway, ahah ",44,
Maxmax,1172,19,"I&#039;d go for AI, if I can dare to ",37,
Moderator,1201,29,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
Maxmax,1216,15,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1221,5,"Hello! ",7,
Maxmax,1227,6,"Hello to you! ",14,2
Andrew,1235,8,"How are you doing? ",19,2
Maxmax,1277,42,"I&#039;m quite fine, thank you. A bit hyped for the new Alien movie which is coming in May, but apart from that all&#039;s good. What about you? ",145,2
Andrew,1337,60,"I&#039;m doing quite alright too thanks! I didn&#039;t know another Alien movie was coming out though, I hope it will be good. ",127,2
Maxmax,1405,68,"Yeah, It comes out during May! I think the middle of May. Anyhow, how is it going for you? ",91,2
Andrew,1457,52,"I&#039;m a bit bored right now, considering playing games or something. ",72,2
Maxmax,1513,56,"Hey, thank you for the consideration! And games are always a great idea to kill bore. Also reading helps. Do you enjoy reading books? ",134,2
Andrew,1578,65,"Sorry I didn&#039;t mean that you&#039;re the one boring me. Just in general. I do sometimes read books yeah, not as often as I&#039;d like too I&#039;m afraid. I don&#039;t feel like I&#039;ve got enough time. ",211,2
Maxmax,1653,75,"No worries. And true, reading takes time, but so does gaming! Which books would you enjoy? Horrors or Fantasy... Same for games! What&#039;s the gameplay you prefer? ",166,2
Andrew,1746,93,"I tend to like RPGs and City Builders. As for books, I like fantasy more than anything, and Science Fiction too. Things that can make you feel like you&#039;re traveling far away in a different world. ",201,2
Maxmax,1847,101,"Mass effect, the old trilogy, would mix everything in a great game experience. Travelling, bit of building, lots of exploring and a ton of RPG elements. Plus, many lovely characters to romance with ",198,2
Andrew,1911,64,"I don&#039;t remember Mass Effect having any building gameplay, but it&#039;s definitely one of my favorite game series. Mostly for the fantastic characters. ",158,2
Maxmax,1990,79,"You could build up your ship in the third and second. Even keeping pets around your floor. And true. Chars were awesome. Loved the mechanic, Liara. I romanced her all the time. So shy but lovely. You?",200,2
Andrew,2067,77,"I romanced most characters I think, but my first one was Tali. She was always so adorable and kinda mysterious. That and I loved her story, with the geths. ",156,2
Maxmax,2114,47,"Did she die in your ME 3 experience? To a friend of mine she suicided, never had it. ",85,2
Moderator,2131,17,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2145,14,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Maxmax,2182,37,"Okay, let me ponder for a second... I&#039;d go for person. ",60,
Moderator,2229,47,"Is this your final answer? Human in the first conversation, Artificial Intelligence in the second? ",99,
Maxmax,2301,72,"Eh, damn it. No, Ill stick with first option I gave. AI first and Person second. ",81,
Maxmax,2312,11,"Sorry, now I&#039;m sure of it. ",32,
Moderator,2318,6,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Maxmax,2343,25,"4,  ",4,
Moderator,2362,19,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,
Moderator,2380,18,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise, you can now close this window. ",117,
Maxmax,2386,6,"I&#039;ve offered it! ",22,
Maxmax,2436,50,"And one thing. Andrew should replay Mass Effect. Liara was the archeologist, not the mechanic. It was a very nice test tho. Hope it works well for you. Have a good one. ",169,
