<span id="time-span">20:06:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello david_r. 
<span id="time-span">20:07:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:07:20</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>My pleasure <img src='smiles/smile.gif'/> 
<span id="time-span">20:07:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">20:07:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">20:07:39</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Sure. 
<span id="time-span">20:07:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:07:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">20:07:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">20:08:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">20:08:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">20:08:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">20:08:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">20:08:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">20:08:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">20:09:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">20:09:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">20:09:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">20:09:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">20:09:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">20:09:47</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Yes, I do. 
<span id="time-span">20:09:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">20:10:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">20:10:01</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Okay. 
<span id="time-span">20:10:21</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Hello, Andrew. 
<span id="time-span">20:10:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">20:10:46</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I&#039;m doing alright. Yourself? 
<span id="time-span">20:10:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite good. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">20:11:26</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Procrastinating... I&#039;m supposed to be doing some work but I&#039;m way too lazy right now. 
<span id="time-span">20:11:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I know the feeling very well believe me. What kind of work do you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">20:12:30</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I&#039;m helping out the local synagogue with their website... it&#039;s just a side gig. 
<span id="time-span">20:13:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I take it you&#039;re in IT? Or do you just make websites for fun? 
<span id="time-span">20:14:14</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I am in IT, but in a different field. I&#039;m not really a professional web designer. 
<span id="time-span">20:14:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I see. In which field are you? 
<span id="time-span">20:15:36</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I am a computational linguist. How about you? What do you do for a living? 
<span id="time-span">20:16:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>At the moment I study Biology. I don&#039;t actually have a job, other than the one I use to pay the tuition fees. 
<span id="time-span">20:16:43</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Which is..? 
<span id="time-span">20:17:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Working at the university&#039;s KFC. 
<span id="time-span">20:17:31</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>You must be sick and tired of chicken! 
<span id="time-span">20:17:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m mostly sick and tired of customers to be honest. 
<span id="time-span">20:18:39</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>What annoys you most in customer service? 
<span id="time-span">20:19:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>When they start randomly harassing you for not being fast enough. Fortunately students are not the most annoying customers. 
<span id="time-span">20:20:33</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Okay, I&#039;ll bite. Who are the worst ones? 
<span id="time-span">20:21:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not sure actually. Being within the university&#039;s walls, I don&#039;t see many others. It&#039;s just that it could be worse. 
<span id="time-span">20:22:26</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Is this your first ever job? 
<span id="time-span">20:22:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup, it is. 
<span id="time-span">20:24:43</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>What are you interested in within the field of biology? Lots of interesting stuff there. 
<span id="time-span">20:25:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Definitely. Mostly trying to figure out how the brain works. Basically everything related to neurology. 
<span id="time-span">20:25:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">20:25:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">20:26:26</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I think it was a human, but to be honest I&#039;ll need the second actor to be sure. 
<span id="time-span">20:27:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, and you&#039;ll have 15 minutes maximum after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">20:27:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">20:27:33</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Hey, Andrew. 
<span id="time-span">20:27:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">20:27:52</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I&#039;m doing just fine. Yourself? 
<span id="time-span">20:28:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What&#039;s up? 
<span id="time-span">20:28:36</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Just avoiding doing some work... nothing major. 
<span id="time-span">20:28:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds like procrastinating. I know the feeling. 
<span id="time-span">20:30:36</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>It&#039;s been a long day, I just want to kick back and not really do much. 
<span id="time-span">20:31:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Just a boring day or have you been busy? 
<span id="time-span">20:31:58</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Work has been murder. Loads of stuff to do, not nearly enough time or people. 
<span id="time-span">20:32:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. What kind of work is it? 
<span id="time-span">20:33:03</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I&#039;m a linguist. 
<span id="time-span">20:33:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh that sounds really cool! What kind of linguist? 
<span id="time-span">20:34:30</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>By training I&#039;m a historical linguist, but I actually mostly work natural language understanding. 
<span id="time-span">20:35:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds like we&#039;d have things to talk about then. I want to study the brain and the cognitive processes underlying behaviors. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:42</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>That&#039;s definitely fascinating. I have only a tangential understanding of this stuff. You are the future, mate. 
<span id="time-span">20:37:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Both of us then. Especially about language understanding. 
<span id="time-span">20:38:45</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>There&#039;s lots of work to be done, still. Which is good, since I don&#039;t want to be out of a job. 
<span id="time-span">20:39:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s a good thing that it&#039;s very demanded lately. Neither do I.  
<span id="time-span">20:40:14</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Do you see yourself in academia? Or making a career in a corporation? 
<span id="time-span">20:40:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Maybe corporation and academia. They are not mutually exclusive. 
<span id="time-span">20:41:43</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I find it a little dodgy when people do both. It&#039;s not really good for academia, in my opinion. 
<span id="time-span">20:42:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sometimes they have partnerships. 
<span id="time-span">20:42:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">20:42:43</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Okay. 
<span id="time-span">20:42:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation? 
<span id="time-span">20:43:02</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>I still think that was the human. 
<span id="time-span">20:43:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how comfident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">20:43:40</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>2. 
<span id="time-span">20:43:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">20:44:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments, feel free to share them here, otherwise you can close this window. 
<span id="time-span">20:44:26</span><span id="name-span">david_r</span>Cool, my pleasure. Best of luck with the study, and cheers.
