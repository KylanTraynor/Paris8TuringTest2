Moderator,0,0,"Hello PokeLucas ",16,
PokeLucas,7,7,"Hello ",6,
Moderator,10,3,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,16,6,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,27,11,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,41,14,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,51,10,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,66,15,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,73,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,83,10,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,94,11,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,103,9,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,114,11,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,125,11,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,145,20,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,153,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,165,12,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,182,17,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,193,11,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,

Andrew,388,11,"Just one year actually. ",24,1
PokeLucas,412,24,"It seems you have done a very good job so far. ",47,1
Andrew,427,15,"What makes you think that? ",27,1
PokeLucas,478,51,"Just a very unique piece of work that no one would&#039;ve imagined of a decade or two ago. ",92,1
Andrew,507,29,"I&#039;m not sure what you mean  actually.",42,1
PokeLucas,548,41,"You are doing a very good job! ",31,1
Andrew,572,24,"Yes but how do you know? I&#039;ve never seen you where I work. ",64,1
PokeLucas,613,41,"Your product itself shows how well you have been working. ",58,1
Andrew,661,48,"You&#039;re confusing me. Which product? ",41,1
PokeLucas,695,34,"Nevermind that, I am just confusing you. But I have made my decision. ",70,1
Moderator,717,22,"Alright. Conversation is interrupted! ",38,
Moderator,732,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
PokeLucas,776,44,"The Artificial Intelligence ",28,
Moderator,810,34,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the second conversation. ",51,

Andrew,843,15,"Hello! ",7,
PokeLucas,849,6,"Hello ",6,2
Andrew,855,6,"How are you doing? ",19,2
PokeLucas,868,13,"Good! How are you doing? ",25,2
Andrew,881,13,"I&#039;m doing alright. How about you ? ",40,2
PokeLucas,901,20,"I&#039;m doing ok. ",19,2
Andrew,933,32,"Sorry about the repeat . Somehow my mind messed up. What are you up to?",71,2
PokeLucas,973,40,"It&#039;s ok. I am just having a conversation with you and watching a movie. ",77,2
Andrew,985,12,"Nice. Which movie is it? ",25,2
PokeLucas,1023,38,"Mike and Dave Need Wedding  Dates. It&#039;s relatively new.",60,2
Andrew,1041,18,"It must be, I haven&#039;t heard about it. ",43,2
PokeLucas,1078,37,"It&#039;s a comedy. I&#039;m quite a fan of comedies since they make me laugh. ",79,2
Andrew,1097,19,"That&#039;s usually the point of them yeah. I like them too, usually. ",70,2
PokeLucas,1124,27,"Are you enjoying the work you are doing? ",41,2
Andrew,1149,25,"Somewhat. It&#039;s just to pay for the tuition fees. ",54,2
PokeLucas,1193,44,"That makes sense. Gotta make money to pay it off somehow. ",58,2
Andrew,1234,41,"Yeah. Serving chicken wings to customers is always very entertaining. ",70,2
PokeLucas,1275,41,"Especially when the customers make it entertaining too. ",56,2
Andrew,1319,44,"Have you ever worked in a KFC? Or anything like that. Customers usually aren&#039;t that fun. ",94,2
PokeLucas,1369,50,"No I haven&#039;t. But I&#039;m sure that some customers aren&#039;t very fun. ",79,2
Andrew,1409,40,"It&#039;s not as bad as it could be. It&#039;s within my university, so I only deal with students. I heard they are not the worst customers. ",141,2
PokeLucas,1483,74,"Well that makes sense. At least the customers aren&#039;t horribly bad. There are some that go insane. ",103,2
Andrew,1539,56,"Yeah. Some people can get annoying for no reason. ",50,2
PokeLucas,1601,62,"Yeah. That is the worst sometimes.But thank you for speaking with me. I have made my decision. ",95,2
Moderator,1618,17,"Alright! Conversation is interrupted; ",38,
Moderator,1637,19,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation? ",80,
PokeLucas,1664,27,"Artificial Intelligence ",24,
Moderator,1682,18,"Are you sure? And what makes you think so? ",43,
PokeLucas,1746,64,"Yes, the conversation seemed slightly more monotone than the second conversation. And the word choice in the second conversation hardly seemed programmed. ",155,
Moderator,1798,52,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months. ",166,
