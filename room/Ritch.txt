<span id="time-span">01:54:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Ritch 
<span id="time-span">01:54:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:55:33</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Hi! 
<span id="time-span">01:55:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">01:56:06</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Yes i am 
<span id="time-span">01:56:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">01:56:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">01:56:26</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Alright 
<span id="time-span">01:56:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">01:56:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">01:56:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">01:56:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">01:57:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">01:57:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">01:57:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">01:58:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">01:58:20</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Yes i do 
<span id="time-span">01:58:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">01:58:39</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Yes i am 
<span id="time-span">01:58:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">01:58:51</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Hi there!

<span id="time-span">02:00:05</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Well, i am watching videos on youtube you? 
<span id="time-span">02:00:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m watching a show on Netflix right now. 
<span id="time-span">02:00:30</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>What is it? 
<span id="time-span">02:01:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not sure actually. 
<span id="time-span">02:01:15</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>What is the name? 
<span id="time-span">02:01:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Of what? 
<span id="time-span">02:01:56</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Of the show you are watching 
<span id="time-span">02:02:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh right. It&#039;s how I met your mother. It&#039;s kinda old, but I had never seen it before. 
<span id="time-span">02:03:02</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Ah ok! Yes i saw it a little on tv 
<span id="time-span">02:03:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What did you think of it? 
<span id="time-span">02:03:50</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>It was interesting, but its not really my kind of show 
<span id="time-span">02:04:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of show do you like? 
<span id="time-span">02:04:59</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>I mostly like medieval shows, such as Game of Thrones

<span id="time-span">02:07:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t know many of those. I&#039;ve liked Death Note a lot though. 
<span id="time-span">02:08:05</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Yes, it was very nice. I mostly watch shonen animes, such as naruto, one piece, death note, etc 
<span id="time-span">02:09:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve tried to get into Naruto, but it&#039;s hard to get into with how short the episodes are. 
<span id="time-span">02:09:49</span><span id="name-span">Ritch</span>Yeah, 19 minutes is really not enough 
<span id="time-span">02:10:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah definitely.
