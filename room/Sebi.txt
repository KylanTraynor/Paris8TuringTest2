<span id="time-span">20:32:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Sebi! 
<span id="time-span">20:32:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:32:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to see this? 
<span id="time-span">20:32:51</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Yes - i&#039;m seeing this :3 
<span id="time-span">20:33:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">20:33:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">20:33:14</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>okies o.o 
<span id="time-span">20:33:18</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">20:33:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">20:33:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">20:33:37</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>U nderstood o.o
<span id="time-span">20:33:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">20:33:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">20:34:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">20:34:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">20:34:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">20:34:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">20:34:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">20:34:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">20:34:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">20:34:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">20:35:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">20:36:12</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Just to be clear: One Andrew after the other Andrew? I don&#039;t know witch one is the machine and i&#039;ve to guess? 
<span id="time-span">20:36:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>That is correct yes. 
<span id="time-span">20:36:39</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>okies - i guess we can start <img src='smiles/smile.gif'/> 
<span id="time-span">20:36:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Remember, no emot and no double post during the chat 
<span id="time-span">20:36:59</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>( Sorry - no smilies ... i try to resist that ) 
<span id="time-span">20:37:05</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>ok 
<span id="time-span">20:37:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready?  
<span id="time-span">20:37:18</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">20:37:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello!

<span id="time-span">20:38:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nice to meet you too! How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">20:38:31</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Well nice. Just enjoying the evening. Where did you came from? 
<span id="time-span">20:38:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I live in Canada. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">20:39:26</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>I&#039;m from Germany living in Wuppertal. Did you know something special about my city? 
<span id="time-span">20:39:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard about it no. 
<span id="time-span">20:40:52</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Did you know what a Schwebebahn is? 
<span id="time-span">20:41:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nope, I&#039;ve no idea what that is. 
<span id="time-span">20:42:12</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>The english translation is overhead railway. could you guess what it is? 
<span id="time-span">20:43:08</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>A train that is on tracks off the ground? 
<span id="time-span">20:44:53</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Correct.  What would be the possible best position for the wheels then and how should they be arranged?
<span id="time-span">20:45:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure really. 
<span id="time-span">20:46:01</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Ok - then another one: You are from Kanada right? You work there? 
<span id="time-span">20:46:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No, I&#039;m actually a student in Biology, but the school year is done and I&#039;m in summer break right now. 
<span id="time-span">20:48:39</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Nice - I&#039;ve heard a thing about kanada. Maybe you can prood it. They are strict quotes on universities for minority groups. Is this correct? 
<span id="time-span">20:49:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure. I mean Canada is very diverse by nature. 
<span id="time-span">20:51:26</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Ok - how many different minorities do you see in your daily life on the university? 
<span id="time-span">20:52:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, I don&#039;t really care enough to count them. I&#039;m not even sure what the majority is supposed to look like around here. 
<span id="time-span">20:52:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">20:52:56</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>ok - thank you ... next?

<span id="time-span">20:57:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not really! Other than Berlin I don&#039;t really know much about cities in Germany to be honest. 
<span id="time-span">20:57:36</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>oh - but you know Berlin? Did you visit a place there? 
<span id="time-span">20:58:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No I never went out of Canada until now. I heard that it&#039;s quite a dynamic city though. 
<span id="time-span">20:59:00</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Oh - it is! Did you know a place there? 
<span id="time-span">21:00:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Other than the Reichstag, not really no. 
<span id="time-span">21:01:09</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Did you know what is on top of the Re ichstag? Could you describe the Building to me?
<span id="time-span">21:01:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I think it has a glass dome or something like that, right? 
<span id="time-span">21:03:04</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Correct - you even can go and visit that glass dome - can you guess how it is inside? 
<span id="time-span">21:03:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not really no, how is it? 
<span id="time-span">21:05:37</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Its actual nice .. you are able to walk around in it and on different floors. could you guess how the floors are connected? Its also possible for wheelchair user to visit that place. 
<span id="time-span">21:06:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s good that they think about people with disabilities yeah, especially for such an important building. And no I can&#039;t really guess how the floors are connected. 
<span id="time-span">21:07:24</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Common. What would be common ways to connect floors for people? 
<span id="time-span">21:07:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, stairs. But I expected something more special than that. 
<span id="time-span">21:08:45</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Indeed - you know the answer - common - what would be usable for wheelchair user? 
<span id="time-span">21:08:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Elevators? 
<span id="time-span">21:09:28</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Good - and ramps? Would they work for wheelchair user? 
<span id="time-span">21:09:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">21:09:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">21:10:15</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>Question: it couldn&#039;t be booth time a machine, right? 
<span id="time-span">21:10:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>No. There is one human and one machine. 
<span id="time-span">21:11:20</span><span id="name-span">Sebi</span>*sign* Difficult - Still i guess first was more machine then the secound  one. 
<span id="time-span">21:11:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer?
