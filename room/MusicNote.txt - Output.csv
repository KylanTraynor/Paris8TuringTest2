Moderator,0,0,"Hello there! ",13,
♫,1,1,"Hey there. ",11,
Moderator,9,8,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
♫,16,7,"No problem. ",12,
Moderator,38,22,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,45,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
♫,45,0,"Okay. ",6,
Moderator,62,17,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,68,6,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,77,9,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,82,5,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,104,22,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,110,6,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,117,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,121,4,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,128,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,136,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,143,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,149,6,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,158,9,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,166,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
♫,169,3,"Yes. ",5,
Moderator,177,8,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
♫,181,4,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,190,9,"Hello! ",7,
♫,194,4,"Hey there! ",11,1
Andrew,200,6,"How are you doing? ",19,1
♫,206,6,"Quite well, thank you. Yourself? ",33,1
Andrew,214,8,"I&#039;m quite alright thanks. ",31,1
♫,234,20,"Glad to hear it. ",17,1
Andrew,250,16,"What are you up to? ",20,1
♫,273,23,"Just having a snack. Do you like pineapple? ",44,1
Andrew,293,20,"Not really no. ",15,1
♫,313,20,"Oh, why not? ",13,1
Andrew,332,19,"I find it a bit weird actually. ",32,1
♫,353,21,"I mean, I think it&#039;s weird on pizza, but just as a fruit I think it&#039;s great. ",87,1
Andrew,379,26,"Well, in juice it&#039;s alright. ",34,1
♫,405,26,"Not just in plain chunks, then? ",32,1
Andrew,456,51,"Nah. Maybe I should try one again though. ",42,1
♫,488,32,"Mhmm. I recommend it. What about pineapple, then? Do you like that? ",68,1
Andrew,502,14,"You just asked. ",16,1
♫,520,18,"Wait, mango. Sorry. ",20,1
Andrew,537,17,"Yeah that&#039;s alright! ",26,1
♫,565,28,"You know their poisonous? The skin, at least. ",46,1
Andrew,583,18,"No I didn&#039;t actually know that. ",37,1
♫,614,31,"Yup. Deadly neurotoxin, I&#039;ve fished. ",42,1
Andrew,642,28,"Probably in very low concentrations though. ",44,1
♫,685,43,"Nah, it&#039;s enough to kill a person from one bite. Dry banana hat. ",70,1
Andrew,731,46,"I think many more people would die if that was true. ",53,1
♫,793,62,"Well, the toxins cook out I think. So it&#039;s just raw mango skin, which bedsheet window I don&#039;t think most hiccup people eat very often. ",145,1
Andrew,852,59,"Why are you adding random words? ",33,1
♫,877,25,"There&#039;s a cat walking across my keyboard. Can I ask you something? ",72,1
Andrew,884,7,"Sure. ",6,1
♫,892,8,"Are you an AI? ",15,1
Andrew,898,6,"No. ",4,1

Andrew,917,6,"What is it? ",12,1
♫,922,5,"Do you like pineapple? ",23,1
Andrew,932,10,"I still don&#039;t. ",20,1
♫,951,19,"Gotcha. Thanks for putting up with my idiocy. ",46,1
Andrew,972,21,"No worries! ",12,1
♫,978,6,"[STOP] ",7,1
Moderator,988,10,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,997,9,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
♫,1019,22,"Wait, I  thought I got to talk to them both before making a decision!",69,
Moderator,1044,25,"You will, this is not your final answer. ",41,
♫,1073,29,"Oh, okay. I&#039;m leaning towards this guy being the AI, then. ",64,
Moderator,1112,39,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
♫,1121,9,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,1124,3,"Hello! ",7,
♫,1131,7,"Hey there! What&#039;s up? ",27,2
Andrew,1146,15,"Not much really. How about you? ",32,2
♫,1162,16,"Just having a snack. Do you like pineapple? ",44,2
Andrew,1188,26,"Nah not really. I&#039;ve had rather bad experiences with that. ",64,2
♫,1199,11,"Really? What happened? ",23,2
Andrew,1230,31,"Well, let&#039;s just say it&#039;s a bit too acid for me. ",59,2
♫,1238,8,"Ooh - upset stomach? ",21,2
Andrew,1252,14,"Pretty much, and toothache. ",28,2
♫,1263,11,"Yeah, I&#039;ve heard that sort of chair can happen. ",53,2
Andrew,1277,14,"That sort of chair? ",20,2
♫,1291,14,"Er, that sort of thing, sorry. There&#039;s a cat walking on my keyboard. ",74,2
Andrew,1306,15,"You wouldn&#039;t believe how common that is. ",46,2
♫,1333,27,"Hey, what time zone are you in? ",32,2
Andrew,1365,32,"Eastern time. Or GMT-5 I believe that is. ",42,2
♫,1379,14,"Oh, so it&#039;s like 10:30 for you? ",37,2
Andrew,1409,30,"Nah, 9:30 actually. You&#039;re one hour off. ",46,2
♫,1421,12,"I blame Daylight Savings time. ",31,2
Andrew,1461,40,"Oh yeah, that tends to make it hard to figure out timezones. ",61,2
♫,1476,15,"Mhmm. ",6,2
Andrew,1493,17,"Mind if I ask how old you are? ",31,2
♫,1513,20,"Sure - I&#039;m 17. ",20,2

♫,1558,22,"Actually I&#039;m just BSing you. I&#039; m 21.",47,2
Andrew,1599,41,"Oh right, that makes more sense. Are you in college? ",53,2
♫,1612,13,"Yup! How about you? ",20,2
Andrew,1635,23,"I am, I&#039;m 21 too actually. ",32,2
♫,1657,22,"Nice, what are you studying? ",29,2
Andrew,1699,42,"Biology. I just finished my 3rd year of undergrad. What about you? ",67,2
♫,1719,20,"Music Education. Hey, quick question. ",38,2
Andrew,1737,18,"Nice! And shoot. ",17,2
♫,1773,36,"What do you think of pineapple? ",32,2
Andrew,1819,46,"Well, scroll back up and you&#039;ll see. ",42,2
♫,1850,31,"Oh, right, yes. ",16,2
Andrew,1868,18,"Yeah. I still don&#039;t like them. That hasn&#039;t changed in 10 minutes. ",76,2
♫,1883,15,"One more question and I&#039;ll let you go, then. ",50,2
Andrew,1891,8,"Ask away! ",10,2
