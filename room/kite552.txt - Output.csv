kite552,15,15,"Hello! ",7,
Moderator,28,13,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,40,12,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,51,11,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,68,17,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,76,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,85,9,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,92,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,99,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,104,5,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,111,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,120,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,129,9,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,138,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,146,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,153,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc)  ",68,
Moderator,160,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,166,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
kite552,215,49,"Yes, with the only question of what will the conversation be about? Or if a topic will be provided? ",100,
Moderator,266,51,"Any topic can be used. It&#039;s completely free. Up to you to find ways to figure out which is which. ",103,
kite552,285,19,"Alright, then yes I understand. ",32,
Moderator,294,9,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. ",87,
Andrew,303,9,"Hello! ",7,
kite552,313,10,"Hello there, it is nice to meet you. ",37,1
Andrew,325,12,"It&#039;s nice to meet you too. How are you doing? ",51,1
kite552,343,18,"Just enjoying my day out of the office. ",40,1
Andrew,377,34,"Nice! What do you do for work? ",31,1
kite552,407,30,"I am a Service Desk Analyst, work answering the phone for people with low level computer issues. ",97,1
Andrew,447,40,"That sounds pretty useful. It also sounds kind of tiring. Some people can be a pain. ",85,1
kite552,540,93,"That is the understatement of the year, but I have to say it isn&#039;t as bad thanks to the type of clients we have. Most are very professional, just not very computer oriented. ",179,1
Andrew,612,72," There are still people having trouble with handling computers nowadays? Other than old people. ",96,1
kite552,695,83,"Sadly, there is. I believe it is due to people live in the mobile age now, they are not used to sitting in front of a computer. They expect everything to be how it is on their cell phone. ",188,1
Andrew,742,47,"Somehow I&#039;m imagining them touching their screen and wondering why it doesn&#039;t react... ",97,1
kite552,822,80,"Well funny story about that, I was just at the local computer store earlier. I felt so dumb, I was trying to demo the new macbook and I was used to my 2-in-1 at work so I was touching the screen. ",196,1
Andrew,896,74,"Well, to be fair there definitely are quite a lot of screens that have touch recognition now, even on desktops, so it&#039;s understandable. Still feels quite ridiculous though yes. ",182,1
kite552,991,95,"Very true, but I can see that the desktop might not go away, but it does feel like it is going to be replaced with more mobile like operating systems. iOS, Android, etc as we move forward. ",189,1
Andrew,1078,87,"Probably. There will always be cases where you&#039;ll need a keyboard and a mouse though. Even if it&#039;s not for gaming. ",125,1
kite552,1118,40,"Very true, I am sure. I am just speaking for the commercial market, where your average consumer buys and uses. ",111,1
Andrew,1160,42,"Yeah that&#039;s probably true. We&#039;ll have to see what the future holds for that. ",87,1
kite552,1201,41,"Very true, but I am sure the on the Enterprise side we have a few more years before it will change in that market. ",115,1
Moderator,1222,21,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1238,16,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
kite552,1276,38,"human ",6,
Moderator,1304,28,"Alright. The next conversation is about to start. Andrew will begin, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. ",127,
Andrew,1311,7,"Hello! ",7,
kite552,1319,8,"Hello again. ",13,2
Andrew,1330,11,"How are you doing? ",19,2
kite552,1353,23,"I am doing alright, just relaxing and drinking some dr pepper. ",63,2
Andrew,1372,19,"Oh nice! Enjoying your day? ",28,2
kite552,1404,32,"It is going alright, just working on my computer. ",50,2
Andrew,1431,27,"You relax while working? Sounds productive! ",44,2
kite552,1468,37,"Well I find working on my own projects to be relaxing.  ",56,2
Andrew,1516,48,"True. I usually don&#039;t really consider it to be work if it&#039;s not at least a bit annoying. But I can see your point. ",125,2
kite552,1586,70,"Yeah, at work I have to deal with other people&#039;s problems, when I am at home I can do what I enjoy. I am the type of person who can not just sit around and do nothing all day. ",181,2
Andrew,1637,51,"Yeah I&#039;m like that too. If I do nothing I end up sleeping. Otherwise I always need to find something to do, whatever that is. ",131,2
kite552,1704,67,"Yeah, but I was very excited. I been building this computer over the past 2 weeks. It is coming along nicely, just got a second hard drive for storing all my files. The OS is on a small SSD. ",191,2
Andrew,1744,40,"I did that for my gaming computer. Well, very moderately. I only changed the RAM... ",84,2
kite552,1781,37,"I don&#039;t see the big difference in the types of ram, gaming vs standard. It really is only minor speed boosts. ",115,2
Andrew,1854,73,"It&#039;s mostly that I needed it for a specific program which loads many bitmaps at the same time. ",100,2
kite552,1923,69,"Yeah, that is the big thing with me. I mean I guess it makes since if you like a hard core gamer or a creative professional. ",125,2
Andrew,2029,106,"Neither of those. I study biology. But I like creating worlds, and the software I use to do that requires many bitmaps of height maps loaded at the same time. ",159,2
kite552,2066,37,"Very cool, I have toyed with virtual worlds myself. I like OpenSimulator it is a great virtual world platform, and it is opensource too. ",137,2
Andrew,2118,52,"I&#039;ve never tried this. I use world machine. ",49,2
kite552,2137,19,"hmm never heard of that one ",28,2
Andrew,2159,22,"Now you have. It&#039;s great at calculating erosion for realistic landscapes. ",79,2
kite552,2186,27,"Ah very cool, but how does that relate to your study of biology? ",65,2
Andrew,2197,11,"It doesn&#039;t, it&#039;s a hobby. ",36,2
Moderator,2221,24,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2236,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
kite552,2258,22,"first conversation I think was human ",37,
Moderator,2267,9,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
kite552,2275,8,"4 ",2,
Moderator,2286,11,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months. ",167,
Moderator,2301,15,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do that now, otherwise you can now close this window. ",113,
