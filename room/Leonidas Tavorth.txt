<span id="time-span">00:40:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Leonida Tavorth 
<span id="time-span">00:40:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:40:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">00:41:08</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">00:41:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">00:41:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">00:42:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">00:42:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">00:42:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">00:45:17</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">00:45:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">00:45:34</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">00:45:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">00:45:47</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">00:45:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">00:46:02</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>I&#039;m doing good. 
<span id="time-span">00:46:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What are you up to? That&#039;s cool! 
<span id="time-span">00:46:29</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Playing a game 
<span id="time-span">00:46:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Which game is it? 
<span id="time-span">00:47:05</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Friday the 13th game. 
<span id="time-span">00:47:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What is it about? I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve ever heard about it. 
<span id="time-span">00:48:34</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Its a game where you either kill camp counselors.  Or try  and escape from camp. 
<span id="time-span">00:49:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it an independent game? Sounds like a funny concept. 
<span id="time-span">00:49:45</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Its more of a game to play with friends. 
<span id="time-span">00:50:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Are you playing online then? Oh nice! 
<span id="time-span">00:50:29</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Oh yeah its an online game. Doesn&#039;t have an offline mode yet. 
<span id="time-span">00:50:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I might have to check it out eventually then. I see. 
<span id="time-span">00:51:53</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Yes, its pretty fun game. Just it tends to have a few problems. 
<span id="time-span">00:52:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Like what? Oh? 
<span id="time-span">00:52:50</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Oh the servers aren&#039;t stable at times. As well if the host leaves a game. It kicks everyone out. For it doesn&#039;t have a host migration to it. 
<span id="time-span">00:53:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds fun nonetheless. What other games do you play? I see. 
<span id="time-span">00:54:49</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Oh I&#039;ve looking into Life is strange. 
<span id="time-span">00:55:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What is that one about? 
<span id="time-span">00:56:18</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>Well its about a girl that can rewind time. As far I&#039;ve got is episode one.  But the looks of things a disaster  will strike soon.   
<span id="time-span">00:56:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Where do you find those games? That sounds pretty cool. 
<span id="time-span">00:58:05</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>I&#039;ve found it on the psn store.  Life is strange is part of the ps plus membership for this month and friday the 13th you&#039;ve got to get digital for now. 
<span id="time-span">00:58:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I was hoping you could get them on Steam. Oh alright. 
<span id="time-span">00:59:15</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>I think you can find them on steam. I haven&#039;t checked on there yet. 
<span id="time-span">00:59:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I play a lot of Minecraft myself. I&#039;ll make sure to check that out. 
<span id="time-span">01:00:52</span><span id="name-span">Leonidas Tavorth</span>I used to play minecraft. But that got boring playing it alone. As well don&#039;t remember my pc account one.
