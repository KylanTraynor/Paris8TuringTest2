M.Trucker.Bear,0,0,"Hello ",6,
Moderator,21,21,"Welcome M.Trucker.Bear. ",24,
M.Trucker.Bear,27,6,"Hello ",6,
Moderator,42,15,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,49,7,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,62,13,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
M.Trucker.Bear,73,11,"Okay ",5,
Moderator,77,4,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,84,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice.  ",38,
Moderator,92,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,101,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,110,9,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,118,8,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,125,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,134,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,141,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,148,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,157,9,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,166,9,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,173,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,181,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
M.Trucker.Bear,185,4,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,200,15,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. ",87,
Moderator,206,6,"Are you ready? ",15,
M.Trucker.Bear,208,2,"yes ",4,
Andrew,215,7,"Hello! ",7,
M.Trucker.Bear,219,4,"Hi! ",4,1
Andrew,226,7,"How are you doing? ",19,1
M.Trucker.Bear,236,10,"I&#039;m not sure. ",19,1
Andrew,248,12,"Oh? Is there something wrong? ",30,1
M.Trucker.Bear,266,18,"Yes my father has late stage dementia.  I authorized hospice care for him today. ",81,1
Andrew,288,22,"Oh... I&#039;m sorry to hear that. ",35,1
M.Trucker.Bear,329,41,"It&#039;s sad that he will be passing soon, but I&#039;m relieved to know that the horizon for the end of his suffering is visible.  I&#039;m not sure if that makes me a bad person or not. ",189,1
Andrew,392,63,"I think it&#039;s quite understandable really. You need to live, and it&#039;s better to live knowing that you don&#039;t have to worry about the pain of people you care about. ",177,1
M.Trucker.Bear,423,31,"Have you had any relatives with dementia? ",42,1
Andrew,445,22,"I don&#039;t, no. ",18,1
M.Trucker.Bear,463,18,"That&#039;s relieving to hear.   It&#039;s a terribly unsettling disease. ",74,1
Andrew,519,56,"I&#039;ve had a friend with the pathological case of depression, but that&#039;s a different disease. ",102,1
M.Trucker.Bear,582,63,"Quite.  I&#039;ve had friends who have suffered from clinical depression as well.  I&#039;m sorry you had to go through that.  It is difficult having somebody who you can&#039;t help no matter what you try. ",207,1
Andrew,643,61,"I imagine on that aspect of it at least, depression and dementia aren&#039;t that different. Maybe the intensity though. ",121,1
M.Trucker.Bear,693,50,"Is your friend okay? ",21,1
Andrew,730,37,"He was alright the last time we talked yes. It&#039;s his birthday soon. ",73,1
M.Trucker.Bear,774,44,"Good.  How do I stop this conversation? ",40,1
Moderator,785,11,"Conversation Interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,798,13,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
M.Trucker.Bear,804,6,"AI ",3,
Moderator,840,36,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin, and you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? ",140,
M.Trucker.Bear,848,8,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,854,6,"Hello! ",7,
M.Trucker.Bear,859,5,"Hi! ",4,2
Andrew,869,10,"How are you doing? ",19,2
M.Trucker.Bear,903,34,"I&#039;m okay.  I took my car into the shop today and learned that it needs new tires, and that it will cost $500 to replace a side mirror.   ",142,2
Andrew,946,43,"Damn. Always nice to have unexpected things to spend money on. ",63,2
M.Trucker.Bear,983,37,"For a certain value of nice.  A small value of nice.  How are you doing? ",73,2
Andrew,1009,26,"I&#039;m doing alright. ",24,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1050,41,"Any unexpected expenses like mine hit you recently? ",52,2
Andrew,1092,42,"Had our two cars drop dead mid-January, other than that no. ",60,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1129,37,"Two is especially unlucky, especially if you live where January is winter.   ",77,2
Andrew,1185,56,"Yeah. We only replaced one though. ",35,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1215,30,"What killed them? ",18,2
Andrew,1273,58,"I&#039;m not really sure actually. ",35,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1336,63,"That&#039;s surprising.  You didn&#039;t have a mechanic or a automotively inclined person (yourself included) investigate them? ",129,2
Andrew,1360,24,"They are my mother&#039;s cars. I just take the bus. ",53,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1418,58,"Do you have any questions for me? ",34,2
Andrew,1464,46,"I&#039;m not feeling really creative, they might be boring. ",60,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1470,6,"That&#039;s fine ",17,2
Andrew,1489,19,"What are you up to tonight? ",28,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1541,52,"I&#039;m going to go to the gym and then have dinner at home with my husband.  ",79,2
Andrew,1566,25,"That sounds quite nice actually. ",33,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1636,70,"Then I&#039;ll probably do some work on a D&amp;D character for this Saturday&#039;s game. ",91,2
Andrew,1659,23,"I&#039;ve never played D&amp;D before. ",39,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1695,36,"It&#039;s fun with the right group of players. ",47,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1704,9,"Otherwise it is a tremendous bore. ",35,2
Moderator,1716,12,"[Please keep it to one post only] ",34,2
Andrew,1728,12,"I can understand that yeah. ",28,2
M.Trucker.Bear,1772,44,"stop conversation ",18,2
Moderator,1772,0,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1789,17,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
M.Trucker.Bear,1798,9,"AI ",3,
Moderator,1802,4,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
M.Trucker.Bear,1809,7,"4 ",2,
