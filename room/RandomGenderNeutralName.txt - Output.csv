Moderator,0,0,"Hello RandomGenderNeutralN. ",28,
Moderator,24,24,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,47,23,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,59,12,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,70,11,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,78,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,88,10,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,96,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,103,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,115,12,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,124,9,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,162,38,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,192,30,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,201,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,214,13,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,222,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,230,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,236,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
RandomGenderNeutralName,250,14,"Yes, I do understand. ",22,
Moderator,260,10,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. ",87,
Andrew,270,10,"Hello! ",7,
RandomGenderNeutralName,284,14,"Hi there, how are you? ",23,1
Andrew,294,10,"I&#039;m doing alright. What about you? ",40,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,323,29,"Me as well, mind if I ask you some pretty random questions to see if you are the bot? ",86,1
Andrew,349,26,"As long as they are still intelligible for a human! ",52,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,361,12,"Is the following word spelled correct? &#039;&Kappa;night&#039; ",64,1
Andrew,385,24,"If you indeed want to talk about a guy in shining armor, yes. ",62,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,483,98,"Well, you kind of passed the first test, a Bot does not know that the capital greek Kappa looks exactly like the capital letter &#039;K&#039; in most stylesets, so yeah, I meant the guy in shining armor. Nice. ",210,1
Andrew,509,26,"Yay, I&#039;m not a bot. ",25,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,597,88,"At least you don&#039;t look like one for now. Okay, next one. I will give you pairs of things that have a very obvious similarity. You will then find a fitting word to complete the last pair, ready? ",200,1
Andrew,617,20,"I&#039;m horrible at this, but go ahead. ",41,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,713,96,"(Sky,Water) (Leaf,Grass) (Paper,The house the president works in) (sand,____) ",78,1
Andrew,766,53,"Yup. I suck at this. Is it desert? ",35,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,786,20,"Well, why would it be desert? ",30,1
Andrew,846,60,"Oh wait. Sky, water, that&#039;s blue, leaf, grass, that&#039;s green, paper, the house, that&#039;s white, for sand, I&#039;d just need something yellow. So sure desert. ",171,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,959,113,"Well, you are able to understand abstract relationships between words, I am pretty sure by now that you are a human or the best bot I ever had the joy to chat with. Well Andrew, can we chat about you?",200,1
Andrew,983,24,"Only if we can chat about you too! What do you want to know? ",61,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,1036,53,"Well, sure, lets just take turns in asking questions. Where are you from? don&#039;t need to be the town, just general region or so. ",133,1
Andrew,1058,22,"I live in London, Ontario right now. You? ",42,1
RandomGenderNeutralName,1131,73,"I am in Germany. I heard a lot about ontario, do you often pet the wild elephants there? ",89,1

RandomGenderNeutralName,1300,20,"Fine, thanks! Mind if I ask some questions? ",44,2
Andrew,1319,19,"Sure, I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s why we&#039;re talking! ",63,2
RandomGenderNeutralName,1350,31,"Is the following word spelled correctly? &#039;&Kappa;night&#039; ",66,2
Andrew,1393,43,"I&#039;m pretty sure that&#039;s right if you meant dragons food. ",66,2
RandomGenderNeutralName,1443,50,"At least you don&#039;t look like one for now. Okay, next one. I will give you pairs of things that have a very obvious similarity. You will then find a fitting word to complete the last pair, ready?  ",201,2
Andrew,1471,28,"I don&#039;t think I&#039;m quite good at that. But shoot! ",59,2

Andrew,1559,13,"It seems to be fitting. ",24,2
RandomGenderNeutralName,1590,31,"Can you name the thing your answear has in common with the prompt word? ",72,2
Andrew,1644,54,"I&#039;m actually a bit confused right now. Wasn&#039;t it the good answer? ",76,2
RandomGenderNeutralName,1718,74,"There were many good answears, I am more interested in your abillity to defend your choice or give a reasoning for it. ",119,2
Andrew,1740,22,"Oh I see. It just felt right honestly. ",39,2
RandomGenderNeutralName,1803,63,"so you do not see what these have in common? look at the third pair, it kind of gives it away as an example of the property is in the name of the structre. ",156,2
Andrew,1864,61,"I honestly don&#039;t. The first two pairs I think I see, but the rest not so much. ",84,2
RandomGenderNeutralName,1911,47,"I used a descriptio of a building, in the third pair, do you know the name of the building I am refering to? ",109,2
Andrew,1941,30,"Trump tower? ",13,2
RandomGenderNeutralName,2013,72,"that is where he lives, but where is his famous office in? I asked for where he works to rule out this option. ",111,2
Andrew,2052,39,"Oh I see. The white house then. ",32,2
RandomGenderNeutralName,2082,30,"okay, what do the white house have in common with paper? ",57,2

RandomGenderNeutralName,2139,33,"Well you are funny, but honestly, I do believe that you are the Bot by now. ",76,2
