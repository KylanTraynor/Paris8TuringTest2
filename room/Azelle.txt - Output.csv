Moderator,0,0,"Hello Azelle. ",14,
Moderator,8,8,"Thank you for participating in this study! ",43,
Moderator,27,19,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Azelle,59,32,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,79,20,"Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",110,
Moderator,86,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,116,30,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,123,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,130,7,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,139,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,147,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,155,8,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,162,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,170,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,179,9,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,188,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,196,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,202,6,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,210,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,218,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Azelle,238,20,"Yes.  Talk to each of them, type [STOP] when I have made my choice. ",68,
Moderator,261,23,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Azelle,265,4,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,284,19,"Hello! ",7,
Azelle,290,6,"Hello.  How are you today? ",27,1
Andrew,306,16,"I&#039;m quite alright. You? ",29,1
Azelle,324,18,"I&#039;m okay.  Tell me, what are your favorite hobbies? ",57,1
Andrew,344,20,"I love video games mostly. ",27,1
Azelle,365,21,"Oh?  What are you favorite games? ",34,1
Andrew,399,34,"Minecraft. I play way too much of it. ",38,1
Azelle,425,26,"How long have you played it? ",29,1
Andrew,461,36,"About 2 years. ",15,1
Azelle,497,36,"Ah.  I played it way back when maps weren&#039;t infinite. ",59,1
Andrew,515,18,"Are you still playing it? ",26,1
Azelle,535,20,"I haven&#039;t played it in a while.  I couldn&#039;t get the hang of doing some of the redstone stuff.  Just seemed tedious. ",126,1
Andrew,568,33,"It&#039;s quite interesting to do though. ",42,1
Azelle,582,14,"What have you made with redstone, if anything? ",47,1
Andrew,613,31,"I made a functional clock once. ",32,1
Azelle,639,26,"That must have taken quite a lot of time, huh? ",47,1
Andrew,676,37,"Yeah, it wasn&#039;t easy to do. ",33,1
Azelle,685,9,"Do you play any other games? ",29,1
Andrew,735,50,"I finished the last Mass Effect a month ago. ",45,1
Azelle,783,48,"Which one was that? ",20,1
Andrew,792,9,"Andromeda. ",11,1
Azelle,821,29,"I could never get into the series.  That and I&#039;ve always heard the quality got worse and worse with each one. ",115,1
Andrew,856,35,"That&#039;s not quite true actually. ",37,1
Azelle,864,8,"Oh?  Why do you say that? ",26,1
Andrew,904,40,"I liked each episode more than the previous one. Except maybe for Andromeda. ",77,1
Azelle,919,15,"Why not Andromeda? ",19,1
Andrew,959,40,"The story wasn&#039;t as good as with the previous ones. ",57,1
Azelle,973,14,"What was the story about? ",26,1
Andrew,990,17,"Settling a new galaxy. ",23,1
Azelle,1050,60,"What was your favorite part about the game? ",44,1
Andrew,1091,41,"The gameplay was quite good, and a fresh start feels nice. ",59,1
Azelle,1131,40,"Have you played any other games from that developer? ",53,1
Andrew,1154,23,"I like Dragon Age too. ",23,1
Azelle,1173,19,"I liked the first one. ",23,1
Moderator,1194,21,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1206,12,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Azelle,1231,25,"If I had to pick, the AI. ",26,
Moderator,1241,10,"Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? ",141,
Azelle,1247,6,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1253,6,"hello! ",7,
Azelle,1266,13,"Hello.  How are you? ",21,2
Andrew,1275,9,"I&#039;m doing alright. How about you? ",39,2
Azelle,1297,22,"I&#039;m doing okay.  Where are you from? ",42,2
Andrew,1324,27,"I&#039;m from Canada. I live in London. You? ",45,2
Azelle,1367,43,"Middle of the US.  How has the weather been? ",45,2
Andrew,1423,56,"A bit cooler than the previous week, which isn&#039;t a bad thing actually. It was way too hot for me. ",103,2
Azelle,1473,50,"Yeah, I know that feeling.  What do you do for a living? ",57,2
Andrew,1513,40,"Nothing at the moment. I&#039;m a student, and I just started summer break. ",76,2
Azelle,1542,29,"What are you studying? ",23,2
Andrew,1566,24,"Biology. I was in my 3rd year. ",31,2
Azelle,1585,19,"What do you plan to do after college? ",38,2
Andrew,1637,52,"Hopefully research on the brain. Trying to figure out the biological basis of learning in particular. ",102,2
Azelle,1681,44,"Interesting.  As in, trying to determine how the brain actually &#039;learns&#039;? ",84,2
Andrew,1740,59,"Yeah. The different neural networks involved in learning fascinate me. ",71,2
Azelle,1795,55,"What do you think would be possible if it was understood better? ",65,2
Andrew,1860,65,"It would certainly help us deal more efficiently with Alzheimer&#039;s disease for one. It might also help us simulate it and make more intelligent programs inspired by biology. ",178,2
Azelle,1924,64,"how would it help with alzheimer&#039;s? ",41,2
Andrew,2044,120,"People with Alzheimer&#039;s disease tend to forget about recent memories, but keep the older ones. Trying to figure out more about the way we learn might shed some light on why that&#039;s the case. ",200,2
Azelle,2106,62,"Is memory related to learning? ",31,2
Andrew,2126,20,"It would seem that it is yes. ",30,2
Moderator,2168,42,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2184,16,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,

Azelle,2244,14,"Human ",6,

Moderator,2264,1,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? ",89,
Azelle,2270,6,"4 ",2,
