<span id="time-span">14:50:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Dharsi. 
<span id="time-span">14:51:10</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Hello 
<span id="time-span">14:51:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">14:51:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">14:51:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">14:51:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">14:52:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">14:52:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">14:52:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">14:52:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">14:52:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">14:53:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">14:53:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">14:53:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">14:53:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">14:53:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">14:54:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">14:54:17</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">14:54:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">14:54:33</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">14:54:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">14:55:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">14:55:17</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Good afternoon! How is it going? 
<span id="time-span">14:55:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s going alright. How is it going for you? 
<span id="time-span">14:56:08</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>I am doing good as well. It&#039;s nice to be on break. 
<span id="time-span">14:56:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Break from school? 
<span id="time-span">14:57:07</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Yes, I&#039;m studying Computer Science. Which is why this study picked my interest. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">14:57:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I study biology actually. I&#039;m on my 3rd year. 
<span id="time-span">14:58:39</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>That&#039;s an interesting field. One I couldn&#039;t wrap my head around in high school, but hey, to each their own, I guess. What do you plan on doing with these studies? 
<span id="time-span">15:00:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I want to learn more about the brain, the way it works, how and why. I&#039;m mostly interested in neurology. 
<span id="time-span">15:00:40</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Whoa, that&#039;s, like, one of the most complicated fields of study. Props to you. 
<span id="time-span">15:01:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Thank you! What about you? 
<span id="time-span">15:01:54</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>What do you mean? 
<span id="time-span">15:02:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I mean, what do you do? 
<span id="time-span">15:03:13</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Well, for now my studies are mostly about maths, with little actual computing, but that will change. 
<span id="time-span">15:04:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Maths have never been my forte... What kind of computing would you like to do? Making programs? AI? 
<span id="time-span">15:04:59</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>I&#039;m hesitating between software development and networking. Although there are other fields that might interest me later on. 
<span id="time-span">15:05:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Games maybe? 
<span id="time-span">15:06:57</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>That probably counts as software development, as games are, after all, software. No, I was talking about R&amp;D, AI, Modeling, and the Internet of objects. 
<span id="time-span">15:07:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Internet of objects like, internet for printers, watches and all that? 
<span id="time-span">15:08:07</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Yeah, connected devices. That&#039;s a field that&#039;s about to blow up in the near future, I guarantee it. 
<span id="time-span">15:08:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I heard it would yes! 
<span id="time-span">15:09:46</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Now, there&#039;s something I wanted to mention: this site looks very... French. The University of Paris, Baptiste Jacquet... Can you speak French? 
<span id="time-span">15:10:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nah I&#039;m Canadian. I&#039;m sure the host could though. 
<span id="time-span">15:10:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">15:10:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">15:11:08</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Is it possible to speak to both actors before giving my answer? 
<span id="time-span">15:11:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>It&#039;s only a temporary answer. You&#039;ll be asked again after the second conversation. 
<span id="time-span">15:12:25</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Very well. While I am not certain, some things point to this actor being a human. 
<span id="time-span">15:13:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. The second conversation will begin. Andrew will start, and you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">15:13:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">15:13:32</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Hello Andrew! 
<span id="time-span">15:13:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">15:14:05</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>I&#039;m doing well. Slow, but enjoyable day. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">15:14:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Pretty much the same actually. Still early though. 
<span id="time-span">15:14:44</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Oh, what time is it? 
<span id="time-span">15:15:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s 9:14 AM. What time is it for you? 
<span id="time-span">15:15:54</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>It is 3:15 PM. I&#039;m guessing you live in North America? 
<span id="time-span">15:16:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I&#039;m Canadian. I live in London right now. 
<span id="time-span">15:17:11</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>I&#039;m sorry, but I didn&#039;t get that. You&#039;re not in London right now, or else it would be 2 PM, right? 
<span id="time-span">15:17:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s London, Ontario. In north America settlers had creative names. Paris is about 2 hours away in car. 
<span id="time-span">15:18:26</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Oh, right. I forgot about this. And I&#039;ve been to Canada, I&#039;ve even seen a road sign leading to London, I should have remembered. 
<span id="time-span">15:18:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No worries, it&#039;s not really a big city. 
<span id="time-span">15:19:31</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Anyway, what are you up to today? 
<span id="time-span">15:20:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much. Probably just going to take a shower and watch some TV, or play games. 
<span id="time-span">15:20:35</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Ooh, that&#039;s interesting. What kind of games do you play? 
<span id="time-span">15:21:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly Minecraft. I&#039;ve played Mass Effect Andromeda for most of the last week though. 
<span id="time-span">15:22:01</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>Whoa, these are two very different games. You still play Minecraft, after all those years? 
<span id="time-span">15:22:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>To be fair I&#039;ve started late. I actually own a server, so my interest in it remains high. The game on its own gets pretty boring. 
<span id="time-span">15:23:29</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>I get that. There&#039;s only so much time I could spend on the game before getting bored of it. What&#039;s your server? 
<span id="time-span">15:24:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s a mix between multiple things. Trying to keep medieval/fantasy themed, but also trying to mix aspects of other games like SimCity and Civilization. 
<span id="time-span">15:25:24</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>SimCity and Civ? In Minecraft? I&#039;m having trouble picturing the two mechanics together. Can you give me the name of the server? I have two friends who would love to check it out. 
<span id="time-span">15:26:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s called Project Mango, it&#039;s still in development though. Basically it&#039;s meant to encourage building cities and empires. Mixing micro and macro management. 
<span id="time-span">15:27:11</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>This seems so deep and rich. It might even get me back into the game. Thanks for that! 
<span id="time-span">15:27:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You&#039;re welcome. You&#039;ve been playing minecraft much? 
<span id="time-span">15:28:26</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>I have kind of stopped, since there was no reason to really play it anymore, apart from minigames servers. But now I might pick it up again, if Project Mango sees the light of day. 
<span id="time-span">15:28:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">15:29:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation? 
<span id="time-span">15:30:01</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>I think I was talking to an AI. 
<span id="time-span">15:30:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">15:30:53</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>4 
<span id="time-span">15:31:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months. 
<span id="time-span">15:31:30</span><span id="name-span">Dharsi</span>You&#039;re welcome! 
<span id="time-span">15:31:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You can now close this window.
