BattleBee,0,0,"Hello ",6,
Moderator,22,22,"Hello BattleBee ",16,
Moderator,37,15,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
BattleBee,44,7,"Heya o/ ",8,
Moderator,54,10,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,61,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,69,8,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,80,11,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,97,17,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,106,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,113,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,122,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,131,9,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,139,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,148,9,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,156,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,164,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,171,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,178,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,184,6,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
BattleBee,204,20,"Stop I just say STOP or [STOP] ? ",33,
Moderator,220,16,"Either way I&#039;ll understand it. ",36,
BattleBee,233,13,"Alright.. Then I&#039;m perfectly clear ",40,
Moderator,245,12,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
BattleBee,265,20,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,271,6,"Hello! ",7,
BattleBee,275,4,"Heya ",5,1
Andrew,284,9,"How are you doing? ",19,1
BattleBee,295,11,"Pretty decently, how about yourself? ",37,1
Andrew,310,15,"I&#039;m quite alright thanks! What are you up to? ",51,1
BattleBee,343,33,"I just ate! So I am just sitting in my sofa relaxing ",53,1
Andrew,370,27,"Oh that sounds really nice. What did you eat? ",46,1
BattleBee,410,40,"Its a danish dish called &AElig;blefl&aelig;sk.. It&#039;s ables, onions and bacon. ",84,1
Andrew,457,47,"I&#039;ve never heard of that. I assume you&#039;re Danish then? ",65,1
BattleBee,486,29,"As danish as you can be.. As in the person, not the pastry. ",60,1
Andrew,523,37,"Alright! I&#039;m Canadian. As Canadian as you can be. ",55,1
BattleBee,535,12,"Sorry, eh? ",11,1
Andrew,549,14,"Yup! ",5,1
BattleBee,582,33,"Is it true that canadians all have ahorn sirup in their cabinets, or is that just a myth? ",90,1
Andrew,618,36,"Ahorn? You mean maple right? It&#039;s... not completely a myth. ",65,1
BattleBee,675,57,"Right.. Maple... Ahorn is the danish word for it... Derp. ",58,1
Andrew,702,27,"No worries. With syrup in the same sentence it was obvious what you were referring to. ",87,1
BattleBee,730,28,"Mmh, there is only that much syrup about. ",42,1
Andrew,750,20,"Especially when we&#039;re talking about Canadian clich&eacute;s. ",66,1
BattleBee,773,23,"On the topic of foods, what is your favourite dish? ",52,1
Andrew,797,24,"To the risk of sounding a bit generic, I really love pizza. ",60,1
BattleBee,826,29,"Thats really vague, Pizza is practically everything now adays, what toppings? ",78,1
Andrew,883,57,"Relatively simple really. I like it with ham, chicken or ground beef, and the rest that goes with a pizza. Spicy is better too. ",128,1
BattleBee,932,49,"Oh, I really like spicy food  too, I like the burn.",51,1
Andrew,959,27,"Yeah me too. I tend to put spices everywhere. ",46,1
BattleBee,1000,41,"I didn&#039;t take time, but I assume time is running. Have you got any hobbies, Andrew? ",89,1
Andrew,1022,22,"I love video games. I spend way too much time on Minecraft. ",60,1
BattleBee,1056,34,"I love Minecraft, I once built an entire castle with a village around it. ",74,1
Andrew,1081,25,"Yeah, I do that all the time. I love building in it. ",53,1
BattleBee,1124,43,"I believe it rounded up to me having used 14.000.000 blocks.. And I played in survival. ",88,1
Andrew,1158,34,"Oh that is quite impressive! ",29,1
Moderator,1178,20,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1194,16,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
BattleBee,1204,10,"AI ",3,
Moderator,1220,16,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
BattleBee,1233,13,"Shoot ",6,
Andrew,1239,6,"Hello! ",7,
BattleBee,1247,8,"Hello! ",7,2
Andrew,1253,6,"How are you doing? ",19,2
BattleBee,1265,12,"Quite well, thank you... How about yourself? ",45,2
Andrew,1281,16,"I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to? ",44,2
BattleBee,1314,33,"Just relaxing in my couch since I just ate. ",44,2
Andrew,1338,24,"What did you eat? That sounds quite nice. ",42,2
BattleBee,1373,35,"A danish dish called &AElig;blefl&aelig;sk! Its delicious! ",59,2
Andrew,1402,29,"What is it? I&#039;ve never heard of it! ",41,2
BattleBee,1465,63,"Apples and onions, stewed on a pan with thyme and salt... It turns into a sweety chunky paste.. with bacon on ryebread. ",120,2
Andrew,1523,58,"Is it something common? That makes me want to try it actually. ",63,2
BattleBee,1571,48,"Its a really old danish dish, back from the 1600, its dying in our culture.. Not all that common in the modern Denmark. ",120,2
Andrew,1637,66,"It&#039;s a shame though. Probably being replaced by burgers like everywhere else. ",83,2
BattleBee,1697,60,"One would think so, ye!.. But actually us Danes are much more fond of chinese food. ",84,2
Andrew,1731,34,"I&#039;m not too fond of that myself. ",38,2
BattleBee,1753,22,"Ever had a spring roll? ",24,2
Andrew,1801,48,"I like these. Yeah I have. Isn&#039;t that Vietnamese though? ",62,2
BattleBee,1844,43,"Now you&#039;ve got me wondering, I always thought they were of Chinese origin. ",80,2
Andrew,1863,19,"I&#039;m not really an expert. They might be. ",46,2
BattleBee,1887,24,"So Andrew.. Do you like games? ",31,2
Andrew,1915,28,"I play Minecraft a lot. Yeah I do. ",35,2
BattleBee,1929,14,"Do you only play Minecraft? ",28,2
Andrew,1954,25,"I&#039;ve recently finished the last Mass Effect, but mostly. ",62,2
BattleBee,1978,24,"What is your thoughts on the ending? ",37,2
Andrew,2002,24,"Of which one? The 3rd or Andromeda? ",36,2
BattleBee,2033,31,"The third one. I kinda forgot that Andromeda came out. ",55,2
Andrew,2067,34,"Especially after they patched it, I liked it actually. ",55,2
BattleBee,2103,36,"One of few, I see.. That ending really split the community. ",60,2
Andrew,2145,42,"I did like it, but I was also disappointed at first. ",53,2
Moderator,2160,15,"Time is up! ",12,
BattleBee,2175,15,"Human this time ",16,
Moderator,2187,12,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,

BattleBee,2237,24,"Can you tell me if I was correct in my guesses? ",48,
Moderator,2259,22,"I can after your comments, or right now if you don&#039;t have any ",67,
BattleBee,2282,23,"I&#039;m fine in regards for comments right now. ",49,
