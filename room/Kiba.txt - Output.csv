Moderator,0,0,"Hello Kiba! ",12,
Moderator,7,7,"Thank you for participating in this study! ",43,
Moderator,20,13,"Are you able to see this? ",26,
Kiba,21,1,"Of course! Sounds fun ",22,
Kiba,28,7,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,30,2,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,43,13,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,53,10,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,60,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,66,6,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,72,6,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,78,6,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,85,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,91,6,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,98,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,105,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,112,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,117,5,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,125,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,132,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,139,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Kiba,152,13,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,158,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Kiba,165,7,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,177,12,"Hello! ",7,
Kiba,194,17,"Hello! Doing well? ",19,1
Andrew,204,10,"I am yes! How about you? ",25,1
Kiba,238,34,"Not bad myself. A little tired but not bad at all. ",51,1
Andrew,248,10,"Is it late for you? ",20,1
Kiba,302,54,"It&#039;s fairly late. About 30 minutes past midnight. How about on your end? ",78,1
Andrew,358,56,"Exactly the same actually. I live in Ontario. I assume you&#039;re on the east coast too? ",90,1
Kiba,425,67,"I am! Just a few hours away from the beach.  ",45,1
Andrew,464,39,"Nice! I can&#039;t quite say the same. I&#039;m a few hours away from Niagara Falls though, so that&#039;s that. ",113,1
Kiba,558,94,"I&#039;ve always wanted to visit Niagara Falls. Of course I&#039;ve heard quite a lot about it, but the only place far north of here that I&#039;ve spent much time at is New York City. ",185,1
Andrew,605,47,"They are quite nice. Crowded with tourists though as you would expect. ",71,1
Kiba,697,92,"No doubt. I would complain but I would be a tourist myself! I might just make a trip there now that I&#039;ve got a bit more free time on my hands.  ",149,1
Andrew,755,58,"That doesn&#039;t sound like a bad idea yeah. Would be a shame not to do it at least once. ",91,1
Kiba,784,29,"Do you have any places that you would be most excited to visit? ",64,1
Andrew,827,43,"I&#039;d like to see Europe. It has fantastic architecture and urbanism. ",73,1
Kiba,912,85,"My university had houses all over Europe, but I never got the chance to go to any of them unfortunately. One day though I have no doubt that I&#039;ll end up making a Euro Tour. ",178,1
Andrew,953,41,"Where would you like to go in particular? Any specific places you&#039;d like to see more than others in Europe? ",113,1
Kiba,1052,99,"I would very much so like to see Venice. Venice and just about any place in Europe that has exciting roads to drive on! I&#039;ve also wanted to visit Singapore and Japan. ",172,1
Andrew,1104,52,"You can&#039;t actually drive in Venice though I think. I also heard that it&#039;s slowly sinking. With climate change and the rising sea level, it might not have much time left. ",180,1
Moderator,1115,11,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1148,33,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Kiba,1180,32,"The AI ",7,
Moderator,1202,22,"Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? ",141,
Kiba,1227,25,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1231,4,"Hello! ",7,
Kiba,1249,18,"Hello! How&#039;re you doing? ",30,2
Andrew,1263,14,"I&#039;m quite alright thanks! How about you? ",46,2
Kiba,1300,37,"I&#039;m doing well. I&#039;m a little tired, but I can&#039;t really complain! ",80,2
Andrew,1337,37,"Yeah me too. Is it actually late for you? ",42,2
Kiba,1368,31,"It&#039;s fairly late. It&#039;s about 50 minutes after midnight here.  ",72,2
Andrew,1414,46,"It&#039;s the same for me actually. What are you doing up that late? ",69,2
Kiba,1485,71,"I&#039;m always up late. I&#039;d definitely consider myself a night owl. ",74,2
Andrew,1527,42,"I&#039;d like to say that I&#039;m different and have a normal sleeping schedule, but that&#039;d be a lie. ",108,2
Kiba,1598,71,"It&#039;s fine really. I&#039;ve learned that I tend to be more productive in the evenings and nights than I am earlier in the day. ",132,2
Andrew,1683,85,"It&#039;s actually the same for me. It probably traces all the way back since highschool where I usually did my homework at night after pushing them back as much as I could! ",174,2
Kiba,1768,85,"I&#039;m not sure exactly when I started staying up later now that I think about it. Do you have any favorite subjects from school? ",132,2
Andrew,1812,44,"What do you mean by that? Like, the different classes I liked the most? ",72,2
Kiba,1829,17,"Yeah! ",6,2
Andrew,1872,43,"I loved science classes in general. Especially biology and physics. How about you? ",83,2
Kiba,1938,66,"Chemistry and biology were always my favorites.  ",49,2
Andrew,1959,21,"Mind if I ask how old you are now? ",35,2
Kiba,2009,50,"I don&#039;t mind at all. I&#039;m currently 22. I graduated from college very recently. ",89,2
Andrew,2028,19,"Did you study biology too? ",27,2
Kiba,2106,78,"I studied biology but most of my time was spent studying chemistry. I particularly enjoyed organic chemistry and biochemistry.  ",128,2
Andrew,2164,58,"I liked organic chemistry and biochemistry too, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;d be willing to make it the center of my studies. ",126,2
Moderator,2174,10,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2193,19,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Kiba,2212,19,"The AI ",7,
Moderator,2228,16,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? ",89,
Kiba,2247,19,"5 ",2,
Moderator,2251,4,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2256,5,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  ",118,
Kiba,2302,46,"Thanks! It was fun, and I look forward to hearing more about the results in the future.  ",89,
