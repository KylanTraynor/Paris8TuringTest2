Moderator,58,58,"Welcome Taberu! ",16,
Moderator,68,10,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,91,23,"If you can see this, say Yes. ",30,
Taberu,97,6,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,109,12,"Perfect. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",113,
Moderator,117,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,126,9,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,136,10,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,144,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,167,23,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,177,10,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,184,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,195,11,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,204,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,211,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,221,10,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,234,13,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,242,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,249,7,"Do not type more than one post at a time. ",42,
Moderator,256,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,

Andrew,467,14,"I&#039;m not sure no. ",22,1
Taberu,499,32,"Ah, they have added concrete to the game, it&#039;s like stained clay but a stronger colour ",92,1

Andrew,640,26,"I was hoping they&#039;d add more wildlife. ",44,1

Taberu,808,39,"I like digging, it&#039;s therapeutic. I can spend hours digging. ",66,1
Andrew,828,20,"I hate gathering resources. ",28,1
Taberu,905,77,"It&#039;s annoying when you can&#039;t find something that you are looking for, but usually a good mining session is a good way to zone out and relax, put some music on and chill ",179,1
Andrew,944,39,"True. I usually just have others gather blocks while I build. ",62,1
Taberu,998,54,"I once managed to build a 9 by 9 automatic piston door in the side of a mountain ",81,1
Andrew,1044,46,"Oh nice! I made a working 4 quadrant clock tower once. ",55,1
Taberu,1067,23,"What&#039;s that? ",18,1
Andrew,1093,26,"Like the London Tower. With a clock on the four sides. ",55,1
Taberu,1117,24,"ah awesome, how long did that take ",35,1
Andrew,1143,26,"A couple of days. ",18,1
Taberu,1186,43,"was it working? or just aesthetic? ",35,1
Moderator,1218,32,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1231,13,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Taberu,1243,12,"AI ",3,

Taberu,1340,14,"I&#039;m okay thanks. Hows the weather? ",40,2
Andrew,1374,34,"Quite windy. There might be a tornado coming toward us. ",56,2
Taberu,1386,12,"Oh dear, that doesn&#039;t sound good ",38,2
Andrew,1413,27,"Yeah. They are not sure it&#039;s going to reach us though. ",60,2
Taberu,1450,37,"Ah that&#039;s good then, Hopefully it doesn&#039;t cause too many issues ",74,2
Andrew,1497,47,"It should be alright. It&#039;s likely just a big storm. It hasn&#039;t been confirmed. ",88,2
Taberu,1518,21,"What will you do in the mean time ",34,2
Andrew,1534,16,"Likely just play Minecraft honestly. ",37,2
Taberu,1554,20,"Ah fair enough ",15,2
Andrew,1571,17,"Do you play that game? ",23,2
Taberu,1581,10,"I do, haven&#039;t done so in a while ",38,2
Andrew,1611,30,"Mmm yeah. It can get old very fast without things to spice it up. ",66,2
Taberu,1662,51,"It&#039;s mainly that I&#039;ve been playing on my friend&#039;s server, and if he isn&#039;t online then I can&#039;t play ",124,2
Andrew,1696,34,"Oh I see. You might want to find a public server then, with your friend. ",73,2
Taberu,1717,21,"I&#039;ve tried that but my PC lags out on public servers as there are too many people ",87,2
Andrew,1743,26,"That&#039;s weird. It shouldn&#039;t be an issue. ",50,2
Taberu,1763,20,"My laptop isn&#039;t very good sadly ",37,2
Andrew,1818,55,"Minecraft also tends to require a better PC than you&#039;d need for other good games. ",87,2
Taberu,1841,23,"Yeah, procedurally generated landscapes take it&#039;s toll on a processsor ",76,2
Andrew,1873,32,"I wonder how they managed to make it much faster on the C++ version. ",69,2
Taberu,1951,78,"No idea, not too familiar with how C++ work. ",45,2
Andrew,1992,41,"I&#039;m not either yeah. What do you like to do in Minecraft when you can play it on your friend&#039;s server? ",113,2
Taberu,2054,62,"I like digging, its therapeutic. But building is always fun, when I can figure out what to do ",94,2
Andrew,2077,23,"What was the most impressive thing you built? ",46,2
Taberu,2108,31,"a 9x9 piston door leading down into a dwarven city. Sadly the city kind of stopped ",83,2
Andrew,2141,33,"Oh that sounds really nice. It&#039;s a shame that it&#039;s on hold. ",70,2
Taberu,2166,25,"Don&#039;t think I still have that save file though. ",53,2
Andrew,2196,30,"What other games do you play, if any? ",38,2
Taberu,2219,23,"Undertale, played it through 4 times so far ",44,2
Moderator,2221,2,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2235,14,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Taberu,2248,13,"AI ",3,
Moderator,2252,4,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
