<span id="time-span">12:17:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Arian 
<span id="time-span">12:17:26</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Hello? 
<span id="time-span">12:17:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">12:17:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">12:17:50</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">12:17:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:10</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Okay. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">12:18:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">12:19:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">12:19:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">12:19:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">12:19:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">12:19:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">12:19:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">12:19:53</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I think so, yes. Do I talk to both actors at the same time, or one at a time? 
<span id="time-span">12:20:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>One at a time. It will be in two conversations, each lasting up to 15 minutes. 
<span id="time-span">12:20:39</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Alright, I think I understand it fully. 
<span id="time-span">12:20:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">12:20:55</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">12:21:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">12:21:10</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Hello! You are Andrew? 
<span id="time-span">12:21:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I am yes! Nice to meet you. How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">12:21:41</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I&#039;m doing well. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">12:21:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright. What are you up to today? 
<span id="time-span">12:22:26</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Well, not much. I&#039;m just playing some video games and relaxing.  
<span id="time-span">12:23:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Nice. Which game do you play? 
<span id="time-span">12:23:17</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>League of Legends. Have you heard of it? 
<span id="time-span">12:23:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I&#039;ve definitely heard of it. Never actually played it though. 
<span id="time-span">12:24:08</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>It&#039;s challenging. Well, what do you like to do? 
<span id="time-span">12:24:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I waste a lot of my time playing Minecraft. I&#039;m really fond of building things. 
<span id="time-span">12:25:26</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I used to play Minecraft a lot, I like those kind of video games.  
<span id="time-span">12:25:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah. I play on a server online. Makes it much more interesting. Otherwise it can get quite boring. 
<span id="time-span">12:26:31</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Yeah, and there are a lot of fun servers to try out.  
<span id="time-span">12:27:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I actually own one. It&#039;s a fantasy/medieval themed server. 
<span id="time-span">12:27:29</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>That&#039;s cool! Is it for roleplaying? 
<span id="time-span">12:28:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>To some extent yes. It&#039;s survival, but takes a lot of inspiration from Game of Thrones and also has some aspects of creative mode in it. 
<span id="time-span">12:28:51</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>How long have you been playing on it? Are there any cool structures you&#039;re proud of? 
<span id="time-span">12:29:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah plenty. I&#039;ve been working on it for about two years I believe, we&#039;re still developing it though. 
<span id="time-span">12:31:22</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Are there any other games you like to play? 
<span id="time-span">12:31:59</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I recently finished the last Mass Effect. I also play city builders and things like that. 
<span id="time-span">12:32:44</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I love city builders, I used to play Simcity 3000 a lot. Do you play Cities: Skylines? 
<span id="time-span">12:33:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah I did! Haven&#039;t played it in a little bit though. I get a bit overwhelmed with mods. 
<span id="time-span">12:34:39</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>[STOP] 
<span id="time-span">12:34:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">12:35:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">12:35:40</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I think I&#039;ve been talking to the human. 
<span id="time-span">12:36:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">12:36:07</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">12:36:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">12:36:23</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Hello again, Andrew! 
<span id="time-span">12:36:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing today? 
<span id="time-span">12:36:46</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I&#039;m doing well. How are you? 
<span id="time-span">12:37:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">12:37:25</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Well, I&#039;m just relaxing a bit before bed. What are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">12:37:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much actually. Considering playing a game or something like that. 
<span id="time-span">12:38:31</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>What kinds of games do you enjoy? 
<span id="time-span">12:39:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly RPGs, and I also like city builders and sandbox games like Minecraft. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">12:39:28</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I like strategy games, simulators, and also MOBAs. I was playing League of Legends earlier. 
<span id="time-span">12:40:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I never played that game. I&#039;ve definitely heard of it though. 
<span id="time-span">12:41:44</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>It can be fun. It&#039;s definitely challenging, and sometimes really stressful. The community is very competitive and sometimes mean. 
<span id="time-span">12:42:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Right, that&#039;s the case with most online games actually. 
<span id="time-span">12:43:11</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Yeah! Especially competitive games.  
<span id="time-span">12:44:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m usually not too fond of those. I prefer following a story. 
<span id="time-span">12:44:43</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Is that why you like RPGs? What are some of your favorites? 
<span id="time-span">12:45:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d say Final Fantasy and Mass Effect are my favorites. I really love their stories. 
<span id="time-span">12:47:18</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I haven&#039;t actually played many of those games, but I hear good things. A good story can captivate me, though. That&#039;s why I like Visual Novels. 
<span id="time-span">12:48:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What kind of Visual Novels do you like? 
<span id="time-span">12:49:32</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I like the Ace Attorney series, and also the Zero Escape series. Have you heard of those? 
<span id="time-span">12:49:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not at all no. 
<span id="time-span">12:50:19</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Have you played any Visual Novels before? 
<span id="time-span">12:50:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Some Telltale games yes, like the Game of Thrones one. 
<span id="time-span">12:51:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">12:51:52</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Ah, okay. 
<span id="time-span">12:51:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">12:52:02</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I think it was the human. 
<span id="time-span">12:52:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">12:52:42</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>I think... 4.  
<span id="time-span">12:52:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">12:53:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  
<span id="time-span">12:53:23</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Cool! Only comment I have would be, what&#039;s the purpose of this study? If you&#039;re comfortable sharing. 
<span id="time-span">12:54:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We&#039;re trying to study the influence of different parameters on the feeling of humaneness given by an artificial intelligence. 
<span id="time-span">12:54:53</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Hmm. Well, it was definitely interesting. Am I allowed to know if I was right, or am I told later? 
<span id="time-span">12:55:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you don&#039;t have any more comment I can tell you right now yes. 
<span id="time-span">12:55:47</span><span id="name-span">Arian</span>Yeah, I don&#039;t have any more comments. It was fun, and I think either way it was a very good AI! 
<span id="time-span">12:56:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. The first conversation was the one with the human!
