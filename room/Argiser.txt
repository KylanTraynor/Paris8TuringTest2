<span id="time-span">14:24:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Argiser! 
<span id="time-span">14:24:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">14:25:04</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">14:25:05</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>No biggie, glad to help. 
<span id="time-span">14:25:12</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Yeah, sure am. 
<span id="time-span">14:25:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">14:25:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">14:25:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">14:25:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">14:25:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">14:26:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">14:26:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">14:26:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">14:26:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">14:26:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">14:26:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">14:26:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">14:26:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">14:27:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">14:27:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">14:27:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">14:27:55</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>I only have one question. If I chose to say stop, it will only be for the current actor, correct? 
<span id="time-span">14:28:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes that is correct. 
<span id="time-span">14:28:17</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>I understand, then. 
<span id="time-span">14:28:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">14:28:30</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">14:28:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">14:29:53</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Hey there! Funny thing both usernames happen to start with an &#039;A,&#039; huh? W hat&#039;s up?
<span id="time-span">14:30:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much! Yeah it happens. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">14:31:17</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Just planning out the rest of the day to better allocate work and relaxation time within a healthy balance. 
<span id="time-span">14:32:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Good luck then! Sounds like a tedious thing to do. 
<span id="time-span">14:33:07</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Just part of every day life. Drawing takes time, so I have to make sure I don&#039;t miss my deadlines. What about you? What do you do? 
<span id="time-span">14:34:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh are you an artist? I&#039;m just enjoying summer break now, I study Biology. 
<span id="time-span">14:36:23</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Yeah, sure am. What all ended igniting your passion to get into Biology? And due to how many fields any one person can go into through biology, which one interests you more? It&#039;s all interesting to me
<span id="time-span">14:38:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>More specifically I study Neurobiology, but I&#039;m only in my 3rd year. I&#039;m mostly interested in the brain and I&#039;ve always been interested in trying to figure out how life works. 
<span id="time-span">14:40:39</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>That&#039;s awesome stuff. So, out of curiosity, any recently released songs that you enjoy listening to? Music fuels my art, and I wanted to take something from this as inspiration for a new piece of art.
<span id="time-span">14:41:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Any specific kind you&#039;re looking for? I mostly listen to video games music actually. 
<span id="time-span">14:42:00</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>That works! Music is music, whatever suits you is what interests me. 
<span id="time-span">14:43:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d say &quot;To Zanarkand&quot; but it&#039;s not really recent. I really like Final Fantasy music. 
<span id="time-span">14:44:03</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Funny, the last drawing I did is inspired by that very game. Seems there&#039;s more coincidences here than the starting letter of our usernames, hah! 
<span id="time-span">14:44:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It would seem yes! That&#039;s an interesting coincidence. 
<span id="time-span">14:44:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">14:45:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">14:45:51</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Am I going to be allowed to change my answer after talking to the second acto r?
<span id="time-span">14:46:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes of course. 
<span id="time-span">14:47:20</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Though it could be either, I say the human actor for now. Tough decision to make! 
<span id="time-span">14:47:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">14:48:06</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">14:48:10</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">14:48:27</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Hey Andrew, what&#039;s up? 
<span id="time-span">14:48:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not much really! What about you? 
<span id="time-span">14:49:59</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Pft, &#039;not much&#039; isn&#039;t very descriptive now is it? Haha. I&#039;m trying to figure out how to manage my work and free time today. 
<span id="time-span">14:50:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It really isn&#039;t, but I have to admit that I don&#039;t really know what else to say! I&#039;m starting to enjoy my summer break though. What are you working on? 
<span id="time-span">14:51:41</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Art, I happen to be an artist. I work on a commission basis, freelancer mostly. 
<span id="time-span">14:52:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh that sounds really cool! What kind of things do you draw? 
<span id="time-span">14:53:42</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>All sorts, though the most recent one is Final Fantasy inspired. I tend to let music ignite ideas in me. What about you, what makes you passionate? 
<span id="time-span">14:55:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I love studying the brain. I&#039;m actually a biology student. I want to figure out all the biological aspects of learning and things like that. I really love Final Fantasy by the way! 
<span id="time-span">14:57:27</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Hah! That&#039;s SUPER neat stuff. Hey, since music drives me, I wanted to ask if there was any one song that had impact in your life that you might want to share forward as inspiration.  
<span id="time-span">14:59:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>A song that had impact on my life? I&#039;d say &quot;To Zanarkand&quot; it&#039;s the one song that made me want to start learning piano, and also is one of the first ones I managed to play. 
<span id="time-span">15:00:29</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Wow, any other instruments you play? 
<span id="time-span">15:00:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No, and I don&#039;t really play much piano either anymore. Just from time to time. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:14</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Hey, with the know how comes the ability to freely practice and develop the skill, you know? I sing, there&#039;s a handful of peeps that have asked me to be in their songs, but I&#039;m not ready. 
<span id="time-span">15:02:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I sing, but mostly just in the shower, or when I&#039;m alone. It&#039;s probably better that way. 
<span id="time-span">15:03:13</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Pfah, everyone has their natural voice. 
<span id="time-span">15:03:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Some sound better than others though! 
<span id="time-span">15:03:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">15:03:43</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Neat. 
<span id="time-span">15:03:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">15:04:16</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>I think the first was the AI, and the second was the human. 
<span id="time-span">15:04:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">15:05:19</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>A solid 6. There&#039;s reasons to believe the reverse answer, but those are fewer from what I gather.  
<span id="time-span">15:05:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">15:06:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. 
<span id="time-span">15:06:25</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Any way I&#039;ll ever know if I was right or not? 
<span id="time-span">15:06:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can tell you right now, but only if you don&#039;t have comments. 
<span id="time-span">15:07:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you do, I can tell you if you were right or not after your comments 
<span id="time-span">15:07:59</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>My only comment was that this was as entertaining as it was interesting. The minor research I&#039;ve done into AI is fascinating and I&#039;m glad I was able to help! 
<span id="time-span">15:08:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you very much! And you were right! 
<span id="time-span">15:10:07</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Neat! I&#039;m proud of me. It was a slight edge in a human touch and response time that made me decide. I&#039;ve taken social classes and have a lot of social experience, so I put all my efforts into using- 
<span id="time-span">15:10:12</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>-that. 
<span id="time-span">15:10:30</span><span id="name-span">Argiser</span>Thank you for letting me be a part in this.  
<span id="time-span">15:11:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for helping! You can now close this window.
