<span id="time-span">23:18:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello BattleBee 
<span id="time-span">23:18:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:19:05</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Heya o/ 
<span id="time-span">23:19:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:19:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:19:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:19:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:19:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:20:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">23:21:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:21:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:21:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:21:45</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Stop I just say STOP or [STOP] ? 
<span id="time-span">23:22:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Either way I&#039;ll understand it. 
<span id="time-span">23:22:14</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Alright.. Then I&#039;m perfectly clear 
<span id="time-span">23:22:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:22:46</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Yes 
<span id="time-span">23:22:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:22:56</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Heya 
<span id="time-span">23:23:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:23:16</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Pretty decently, how about yourself? 
<span id="time-span">23:23:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite alright thanks! What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:24:04</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>I just ate! So I am just sitting in my sofa relaxing 
<span id="time-span">23:24:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh that sounds really nice. What did you eat? 
<span id="time-span">23:25:11</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Its a danish dish called &AElig;blefl&aelig;sk.. It&#039;s ables, onions and bacon. 
<span id="time-span">23:25:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never heard of that. I assume you&#039;re Danish then? 
<span id="time-span">23:26:27</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>As danish as you can be.. As in the person, not the pastry. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Alright! I&#039;m Canadian. As Canadian as you can be. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:16</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Sorry, eh? 
<span id="time-span">23:27:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup! 
<span id="time-span">23:28:03</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Is it true that canadians all have ahorn sirup in their cabinets, or is that just a myth? 
<span id="time-span">23:28:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ahorn? You mean maple right? It&#039;s... not completely a myth. 
<span id="time-span">23:29:36</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Right.. Maple... Ahorn is the danish word for it... Derp. 
<span id="time-span">23:30:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No worries. With syrup in the same sentence it was obvious what you were referring to. 
<span id="time-span">23:30:31</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Mmh, there is only that much syrup about. 
<span id="time-span">23:30:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Especially when we&#039;re talking about Canadian clich&eacute;s. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:14</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>On the topic of foods, what is your favourite dish? 
<span id="time-span">23:31:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>To the risk of sounding a bit generic, I really love pizza. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:07</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Thats really vague, Pizza is practically everything now adays, what toppings? 
<span id="time-span">23:33:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Relatively simple really. I like it with ham, chicken or ground beef, and the rest that goes with a pizza. Spicy is better too. 
<span id="time-span">23:33:53</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Oh, I really like spicy food  too, I like the burn.
<span id="time-span">23:34:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah me too. I tend to put spices everywhere. 
<span id="time-span">23:35:01</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>I didn&#039;t take time, but I assume time is running. Have you got any hobbies, Andrew? 
<span id="time-span">23:35:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I love video games. I spend way too much time on Minecraft. 
<span id="time-span">23:35:57</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>I love Minecraft, I once built an entire castle with a village around it. 
<span id="time-span">23:36:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah, I do that all the time. I love building in it. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:05</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>I believe it rounded up to me having used 14.000.000 blocks.. And I played in survival. 
<span id="time-span">23:37:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh that is quite impressive! 
<span id="time-span">23:37:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:38:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">23:38:25</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>AI 
<span id="time-span">23:38:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:38:54</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Shoot 
<span id="time-span">23:39:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:39:08</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:39:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">23:39:26</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Quite well, thank you... How about yourself? 
<span id="time-span">23:39:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">23:40:15</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Just relaxing in my couch since I just ate. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What did you eat? That sounds quite nice. 
<span id="time-span">23:41:14</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>A danish dish called &AElig;blefl&aelig;sk! Its delicious! 
<span id="time-span">23:41:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What is it? I&#039;ve never heard of it! 
<span id="time-span">23:42:46</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Apples and onions, stewed on a pan with thyme and salt... It turns into a sweety chunky paste.. with bacon on ryebread. 
<span id="time-span">23:43:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it something common? That makes me want to try it actually. 
<span id="time-span">23:44:32</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Its a really old danish dish, back from the 1600, its dying in our culture.. Not all that common in the modern Denmark. 
<span id="time-span">23:45:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s a shame though. Probably being replaced by burgers like everywhere else. 
<span id="time-span">23:46:38</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>One would think so, ye!.. But actually us Danes are much more fond of chinese food. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not too fond of that myself. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:34</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Ever had a spring roll? 
<span id="time-span">23:48:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I like these. Yeah I have. Isn&#039;t that Vietnamese though? 
<span id="time-span">23:49:05</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Now you&#039;ve got me wondering, I always thought they were of Chinese origin. 
<span id="time-span">23:49:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not really an expert. They might be. 
<span id="time-span">23:49:48</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>So Andrew.. Do you like games? 
<span id="time-span">23:50:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I play Minecraft a lot. Yeah I do. 
<span id="time-span">23:50:30</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Do you only play Minecraft? 
<span id="time-span">23:50:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve recently finished the last Mass Effect, but mostly. 
<span id="time-span">23:51:19</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>What is your thoughts on the ending? 
<span id="time-span">23:51:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Of which one? The 3rd or Andromeda? 
<span id="time-span">23:52:14</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>The third one. I kinda forgot that Andromeda came out. 
<span id="time-span">23:52:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Especially after they patched it, I liked it actually. 
<span id="time-span">23:53:24</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>One of few, I see.. That ending really split the community. 
<span id="time-span">23:54:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I did like it, but I was also disappointed at first. 
<span id="time-span">23:54:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">23:54:36</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Human this time 
<span id="time-span">23:54:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">23:54:58</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>6 
<span id="time-span">23:55:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">23:55:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. 
<span id="time-span">23:55:38</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Can you tell me if I was correct in my guesses? 
<span id="time-span">23:56:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can after your comments, or right now if you don&#039;t have any 
<span id="time-span">23:56:23</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>I&#039;m fine in regards for comments right now. 
<span id="time-span">23:56:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The first one was the human! 
<span id="time-span">23:57:10</span><span id="name-span">BattleBee</span>Well, fuck.. 
<span id="time-span">23:58:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you a lot for your help!
