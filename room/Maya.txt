<span id="time-span">02:03:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Maya. 
<span id="time-span">02:03:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello Maya. 
<span id="time-span">02:03:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">02:03:42</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Hi Mr. Moderator! 
<span id="time-span">02:03:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">02:04:07</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Are you a bot too? 
<span id="time-span">02:04:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">02:04:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>No I&#039;m not. I just have pre-defined speech to say. 
<span id="time-span">02:04:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">02:04:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">02:05:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">02:05:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">02:05:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">02:05:22</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Am I supposed/allowed to ask questions designed to &quot;break&quot; the AI, basically? 
<span id="time-span">02:05:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re welcome to yes. 
<span id="time-span">02:05:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">02:06:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">02:06:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">02:06:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">02:06:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">02:06:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">02:06:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">02:06:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">02:07:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">02:07:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">02:07:44</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I usually use emotes/smilies in my text messages as a habit. To make sure, you&#039;re telling me to keep them out of my messages, yes? 
<span id="time-span">02:08:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>That is correct yes. It&#039;s in order to keep it fair to both the AI and the Human. 
<span id="time-span">02:08:39</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>All right. Anything else, any punctuation you&#039;d normally expect in text is fair game? 
<span id="time-span">02:09:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Anything else is fair game. Try to keep talking to the character of Andrew though, and not the actors directly. 
<span id="time-span">02:09:17</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>What about typos/&quot;weird&quot; phrasing? Can I use that in order to try to confuse a bot with something a human would be able to understand? 
<span id="time-span">02:09:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes you can do that too. 
<span id="time-span">02:09:55</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Okay. I think I&#039;m clear on the rules now. 
<span id="time-span">02:10:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">02:10:09</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I am. 
<span id="time-span">02:10:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">02:10:21</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Hi Andrew! 
<span id="time-span">02:10:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">02:10:44</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I&#039;m fine, thank you. A little excited about all of this. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">02:11:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! A bit tired though, glad that you&#039;re excited! 
<span id="time-span">02:11:23</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Tired? What&#039;s the time where you are? 
<span id="time-span">02:11:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s not that late actually. I just had a long day. It&#039;s 8 pm. 
<span id="time-span">02:12:36</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>8pm? What&#039;s that in &quot;real&quot; time units? None of that 12h stuff! 
<span id="time-span">02:13:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s 20:12 to be accurate. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">02:14:08</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>2:13! That would put you in...GMT-5 DST I assume. East Coast? 
<span id="time-span">02:14:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Wow that&#039;s pretty late for you. And yeah, I live in the Ontario (Canada). 
<span id="time-span">02:15:30</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Yeah, I tend to stay up pretty late. What itme do you usually go? 
<span id="time-span">02:16:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Like, go to bed? Usually around midnight. 
<span id="time-span">02:16:47</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>What d&#039;you work as then? 
<span id="time-span">02:17:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t really work anymore actually. It&#039;s summer break for me. I&#039;m just having rough nights. 
<span id="time-span">02:17:45</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Bad draeam problems? 
<span id="time-span">02:18:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not really, it&#039;s more like I can&#039;t sleep. I end up trapped on youtube. 
<span id="time-span">02:19:19</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Hah! What sorts of stuff do you go for there? 
<span id="time-span">02:20:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It can be very random. Sometimes just music videos, other times videos about the president on the other side of the border... Random. 
<span id="time-span">02:21:16</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>May I ask wht you think about him? 
<span id="time-span">02:21:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>He&#039;s entertaining to watch at least. What do you think? 
<span id="time-span">02:22:52</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I think he&#039;s a smart guy posing to be dumb for publicity. And it&#039;s working. Did you hear about his Tweet, with that supposed &quot;typo&quot;? 
<span id="time-span">02:23:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not sure. What was it about? 
<span id="time-span">02:24:38</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Supposedly he mistyped &quot;coverage&quot; as &quot;covfefe&quot;. And now it&#039;s all over the web, people calling him oh, so stupid, when it&#039;s obvious that that&#039;s a publicity stunt. Or do you believe that? 
<span id="time-span">02:25:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">02:25:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">02:26:25</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Can I quickly look back at the messages, or would you like me to make a gut decision now? 
<span id="time-span">02:26:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can wait. This is not your final answer anyway. 
<span id="time-span">02:28:05</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>There&#039;s some indication either way. I&#039;d be pretty impressed if a bot got the 12-24h thing right the way I phrased it, but then I&#039;d imagine everyone would&#039;ve heard of that tweet since it was all... 
<span id="time-span">02:28:13</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>...over the web. 
<span id="time-span">02:28:47</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I&#039;m really interested to see the other person-slash-bot now though. Since they&#039;re playing the same character, this might shed some more light on it for me. 
<span id="time-span">02:29:19</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>After this, I can&#039;t say for sure though. If I *had* to guess, I&#039;d say human, but it&#039;s difficult. 
<span id="time-span">02:29:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">02:29:57</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Yep! 
<span id="time-span">02:30:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">02:30:21</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Hi Andrew! 
<span id="time-span">02:30:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">02:30:50</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I&#039;m fine. Intrigued. And yourself ?
<span id="time-span">02:31:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m quite alright, thanks. 
<span id="time-span">02:31:37</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>What have you been up to today? 
<span id="time-span">02:32:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Had a lot of work to do on the house. Pretty tiring. 
<span id="time-span">02:32:40</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Oh? New house or just renovai tons?
<span id="time-span">02:32:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Just renovations yeah. 
<span id="time-span">02:33:34</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Sorry for the random spaces, the chat seems to insert those when I delete and add a letter. Let me tset that. 
<span id="time-span">02:34:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>No worries. 
<span id="time-span">02:34:16</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Yeah, it didn&#039;t seem to happen there anyway. Just my luck! 
<span id="time-span">02:34:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>And you, how was your day? 
<span id="time-span">02:35:36</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>My day...pretty relaxed to be honest. I work a lot, so I just decided to take a day off now, especially since it&#039;s the weekend and all. What do oyu work as? 
<span id="time-span">02:36:09</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I study biology, but I&#039;m in summer break. 
<span id="time-span">02:36:44</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I see! What kinds of jobs can you look towards with that? 
<span id="time-span">02:37:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly research. I&#039;m particularly interested in neurobiology. 
<span id="time-span">02:37:33</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Does it  pay well?
<span id="time-span">02:37:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not really. But it&#039;s interesting. 
<span id="time-span">02:38:00</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Money not your primary objective then? 
<span id="time-span">02:38:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I prefer working for something motivating yes. 
<span id="time-span">02:39:06</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>So where in the world are you? 
<span id="time-span">02:39:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Canada. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">02:39:41</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Austria! Quite the distance. What&#039;s the time for you then? 
<span id="time-span">02:40:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s 8:40pm right now. 
<span id="time-span">02:40:28</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Can you give me that in &quot;real&quot; time units? We don&#039;t understand that 12h stuff here! 
<span id="time-span">02:40:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>20:40 
<span id="time-span">02:41:21</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Ah, thank you. So six hours behind me. You&#039;re quite a bit further up north, is it as hot there as it is ehere? 
<span id="time-span">02:42:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s rather hot right now yeah. For Canada. 
<span id="time-span">02:42:25</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Oh? How hot? Again, I&#039;ll need &quot;real&quot; units if possible! 
<span id="time-span">02:43:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s about 30&deg;C. 
<span id="time-span">02:43:27</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Whewf. Got an AC? 
<span id="time-span">02:43:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Thank god yes. 
<span id="time-span">02:44:07</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>What&#039;s your comfort tempreture then? 
<span id="time-span">02:44:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Around 20&deg;C I guess. 
<span id="time-span">02:44:58</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Oh my. You must be working that poor AC to death! 
<span id="time-span">02:45:39</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">02:45:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the FIRST conversation? 
<span id="time-span">02:46:54</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Well, it&#039;s definitely not a crystal clear choice. Either way, it&#039;s a really good AI. 
<span id="time-span">02:47:13</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>But since I have to guess, I&#039;ll say the first one was the human. And I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;ve just called someone a robot! 
<span id="time-span">02:47:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not certain at all) to 7 (absolutely sure) how confident are you of your choice? 
<span id="time-span">02:48:25</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I&#039;d say around a 4. My gut says the first one was the human, but analytically, I really don&#039;t know. 
<span id="time-span">02:49:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thanks a lot for participating. If you&#039;ve given an e-mail address you&#039;ll receive the general results of this study once it will be completed. 
<span id="time-span">02:49:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise, you can close this window. 
<span id="time-span">02:49:30</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Will you tell me whether I was right? 
<span id="time-span">02:49:39</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Cause I&#039;m actually pretty damn curious! 
<span id="time-span">02:49:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can tell you after your comments, or right now if you don&#039;t have any. 
<span id="time-span">02:50:30</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>My only comment is that this has been super interesting, and while I expected this to be difficult, I also expected to be able to catch the bot off-guard with some &quot;meaner&quot; questions. 
<span id="time-span">02:50:38</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Then again I&#039;m not an expert on AI, but still. I&#039;m impressed. 
<span id="time-span">02:51:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I&#039;m glad that you are. The first conversation was indeed with the human. 
<span id="time-span">02:51:47</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>All right. Would you like me to share the things I think tipped me off a little? 
<span id="time-span">02:52:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Sure! 
<span id="time-span">02:52:54</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>All right, so, it *was* pretty impressive that it understood my request to put it into 24h time and centigrade the way I phrased it. 
<span id="time-span">02:53:16</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>It&#039;s answers just...seemed a tiny bit too cold. Had I not had the conversation with the human as well, I might&#039;ve thought it&#039;s just that kind of personality though. 
<span id="time-span">02:53:40</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>But compared to &quot;the other Andrew&quot;, it was just something that tipped me off a little. 
<span id="time-span">02:54:21</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Like, when I tried to take the conversation into a slightly more humorous manner, it didn&#039;t respond to that at all. 
<span id="time-span">02:54:41</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Like I said, it could indicate just that kind of personality, but the first Andrew did, and in comparison it just made the other one seem a bit cold. 
<span id="time-span">02:55:07</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I see, It does make perfect sense yes. 
<span id="time-span">02:55:35</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Just like when he responded to my request with a plain &quot;20:40&quot;. Some humans would act like that, yes, but when put next to an actual human, it can often seem a little cold. 
<span id="time-span">02:56:08</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Because they would tend to embellish it, be nice, say &quot;Oh, of course, it&#039;s 20:40.&quot; and maybe even make an off-hand comment about how silly the different time systems are. 
<span id="time-span">02:56:22</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Or get back at me for ridiculing 12h somehow in a playful manner, depending on personality. 
<span id="time-span">02:56:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Right, (am/pm is quite a ridiculous system XD) 
<span id="time-span">02:57:11</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>I think that&#039;s about it. Easy for me to say, but make it seem a little...warmer and that might just be it. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:32</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>And without the direct comparison to a human it would likely have fooled me. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thanks a lot for your comments, and thank you again for participating, especially that late for you. 
<span id="time-span">02:58:26</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>It&#039;s fine. It was super interesting, and I hope I could help a bit. Anything else I can do? 
<span id="time-span">02:59:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Maybe talk about it to people you know, especially within the next 3 days ^^ 
<span id="time-span">02:59:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>(also, if you could poke me again where we first talked together) 
<span id="time-span">02:59:33</span><span id="name-span">Maya</span>Oh I am! Not giving them any hints of course, just letting them know it&#039;s a thing and pointing them your way. 
<span id="time-span">03:00:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thanks again, you can now close this window.
