Moderator,0,0,"Welcome Midgardian! ",20,
Moderator,21,21,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,29,8,"Please say &quot;Yes&quot; if you can see this. ",48,
Midgardian,64,35,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,80,16,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,87,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,95,8,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,104,9,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,115,11,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,122,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,133,11,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,140,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,146,6,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,155,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,162,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,171,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,179,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,186,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,194,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,201,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Midgardian,211,10,"Yes, I do. ",11,
Moderator,217,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Midgardian,224,7,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,232,8,"Hello! ",7,
Midgardian,238,6,"Hi! ",4,1
Andrew,245,7,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Midgardian,255,10,"Fine, you? ",11,1
Andrew,278,23,"I&#039;m doing fine too thanks! What are you up to? ",52,1
Midgardian,292,14,"Nothing really, just talking to you. ",37,1
Andrew,320,28,"I hope I won&#039;t bore you too much then! ",44,1
Midgardian,339,19,"No you won&#039;t, I think. ",28,1
Andrew,376,37,"What do you like to do? I mean, playing games, reading books, things like that? ",80,1
Midgardian,424,48,"I like reading books actually, thanks for asking, but I couldn&#039;t do that for a long time because of school. ",113,1
Andrew,476,52,"Yeah I feel the same about books. I feel like I don&#039;t read enough, yet I never feel like I have enough time to start one. ",127,1
Midgardian,550,74,"What was the last book you read? ",33,1
Andrew,601,51,"It&#039;s a book about dragons. It&#039;s called... Dragons! Surprising isn&#039;t it? ",87,1
Midgardian,641,40,"Yeah, shocking even.  ",22,1
Andrew,680,39,"Anyways, what about you? ",25,1
Midgardian,758,78,"Nothing exciting about me. Just being lazy at the moment. ",58,1
Andrew,813,55,"Well, being lazy is good from time to time. ",44,1
Midgardian,866,53,"Yes, I usually hated being lazy, but lately I concluded that we need it from time to time. ",91,1
Andrew,913,47,"It&#039;s better than running everywhere and ending up so stressed you can&#039;t do anything about it. ",104,1
Midgardian,1006,93,"Yes, definitely, because I didn&#039;t rested so much, I was feeling so stressed lately. That&#039;s not good. ",111,1
Andrew,1040,34,"Why were you so stressed? ",26,1
Midgardian,1062,22,"Because of the lectures and exams and writing thesis etc. ",58,1
Andrew,1080,18,"Oh right, it&#039;s this period of the year isn&#039;t it? ",59,1
Midgardian,1098,18,"Yes, sadly it is. ",18,1
Andrew,1126,28,"It&#039;s always so annoying. ",30,1
Moderator,1143,17,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1159,16,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Midgardian,1173,14,"Human ",6,
Moderator,1190,17,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
Midgardian,1220,30,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1226,6,"Hello! ",7,
Midgardian,1250,24,"Hi! ",4,2
Andrew,1261,11,"How are you doing? ",19,2
Midgardian,1273,12,"Fine, I guess. ",15,2
Andrew,1298,25,"Doesn&#039;t sound like it. Is there something wrong? ",54,2
Midgardian,1367,69,"Oh no, not really, just I&#039;m tired a bit. How are you doing by the way? ",76,2
Andrew,1393,26,"Oh alright. Sorry about that. I&#039;m doing alright. A bit tired too actually. ",80,2
Midgardian,1433,40,"Oh really, you should rest, if you try to hard, it gets more stressing eventually. ",83,2
Andrew,1480,47,"Yeah I should. But for now I&#039;ve got to be here! What are you up to? ",73,2
Midgardian,1563,83,"Nothing actually, just resting and letting the stress go away. Next week my exams start so these are my final free days. ",121,2
Andrew,1618,55,"Oh right. It&#039;s that period of the year. I&#039;m sorry to hear that, but at least once they&#039;re done you&#039;ll be free again. ",137,2
Midgardian,1662,44,"Yeah, I hope so. Otherwise, I could blow out out of stress.  ",61,2
Andrew,1720,58,"Stress can help if it&#039;s only from time to time. But when it spreads over weeks or more, it really starts becoming dangerous. ",130,2
Midgardian,1748,28,"Are you stressed too? ",22,2
Andrew,1782,34,"Yeah I am. I&#039;ve got a couple of deadlines getting closer and closer every day. ",84,2
Midgardian,1830,48,"So what&#039;s your part in this study, are you just helping or are you in the team? ",85,2
Andrew,1870,40,"I&#039;m just helping yeah. I study Biology actually. ",54,2
Midgardian,1919,49,"Really? My major is Biology too. ",33,2
Andrew,1952,33,"Oh nice! Which part are you most specifically interested in? Neurology for me. ",79,2
Midgardian,2007,55,"I&#039;m interested in neurology too, but I want to study in animal behaviour and cognition. ",93,2
Andrew,2061,54,"Animal cognition? Or animal behaviour and cognition in general? ",64,2
Midgardian,2090,29,"In general, but I&#039;m not sure how am I going to study them both or mix them&ccedil; ",88,2
Andrew,2139,49,"That&#039;s a pretty awesome Major actually. I wish you luck and success! ",74,2
Moderator,2159,20,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2175,16,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
