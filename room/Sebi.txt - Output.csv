Moderator,42,11,"Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",110,
Moderator,49,7,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,

Moderator,64,6,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,71,7,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
