<span id="time-span">18:47:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Takeru. 
<span id="time-span">18:48:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">18:48:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you can see this, please type &quot;yes&quot; 
<span id="time-span">18:48:21</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">18:48:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">18:48:35</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">18:48:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">18:48:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">18:49:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">18:49:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">18:49:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">18:49:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">18:50:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">18:50:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">18:50:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">18:50:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">18:50:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">18:50:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">18:51:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">18:51:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">18:51:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">18:51:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">18:51:41</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">18:51:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">18:51:56</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">18:52:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">18:52:13</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Hi, how are you? 
<span id="time-span">18:52:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? 
<span id="time-span">18:53:07</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>I am going okay. What do you wanna talk about? 
<span id="time-span">18:53:28</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Up to you really. What are you up to today? 
<span id="time-span">18:54:29</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Not much, some work on the garden, I still have to do some shopping today and then watch some TV shows. 
<span id="time-span">18:54:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh alright! What TV shows do you watch? 
<span id="time-span">18:56:23</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>My most favorite as of now are shows from Arrowverse. Oh, and I saw they started airing new Attack on Titan, gotta catch up on that one. 
<span id="time-span">18:57:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh they did? I didn&#039;t know about that. I liked that anime a lot but I thought there wouldn&#039;t be any more episodes. 
<span id="time-span">18:59:19</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Season 2 was announced for quite some time, I think. Well, 2 or 3 episodes are out now. I would more welcome to see Season 2 of No Game No Life though. Well, at least there is gonna be a movie. 
<span id="time-span">18:59:48</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve never heard of that one. What is it about? 
<span id="time-span">19:01:30</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>No Game No Life? It&#039;s about 2 siblings, brother and sister, who are avid gamers with unmatched gaming skills. They are invited by god of games to live in his world where games decide everything. 
<span id="time-span">19:02:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That actually sounds quite fun. I should check it out! 
<span id="time-span">19:03:10</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Speaking of things that I enjoy, have you heard of game called Undertale? 
<span id="time-span">19:03:33</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I have yes. I&#039;ve never played it though. 
<span id="time-span">19:04:40</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>I hope you did not watch any spoilers. I did and I wish I didn&#039;t. Games like these are best experienced first hand. 
<span id="time-span">19:05:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Would you recommend it to me then? 
<span id="time-span">19:06:17</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Heh, recomend... During Christmas sale I bought it 7 times to give it to all of my friends who had it on wishlist. 
<span id="time-span">19:07:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Right. And alright. I&#039;ll try to get it soon then. 
<span id="time-span">19:07:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">19:07:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">19:08:00</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>human 
<span id="time-span">19:08:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">19:09:21</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>yes 
<span id="time-span">19:09:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">19:09:42</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Hi. How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">19:09:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright. How about you? 
<span id="time-span">19:10:42</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>I am doing good. What would you like to talk about? 
<span id="time-span">19:11:04</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s up to you really. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">19:11:52</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Not much. I have some shopping ahead, then I am gonna watch some TV shows and maybe some YouTube videos. 
<span id="time-span">19:12:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh nice! What TV shows do you like? 
<span id="time-span">19:14:19</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Sometimes I watch Doctor Who, but my favorite are shows from Arrowverse. Plus season 2 of Attack on Titan started airing recently, so I will definitely go watch it. 
<span id="time-span">19:15:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh really? I didn&#039;t know they&#039;re doing another season of Attack on Titan. I&#039;ll have to watch that too. For Doctor Who and the Arrowverse I don&#039;t know much about I have to admit. 
<span id="time-span">19:16:44</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Yeah, it&#039;s out there. I would definitely suggest watching Doctor Who, it&#039;s pretty cool sci-fi show. 
<span id="time-span">19:17:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I watched one or two  random episodes I believe, but I never know where to start. There&#039;s so many seasons, and the first one seemed quite old to me. 
<span id="time-span">19:19:43</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>I know what you mean. I got hooked thanks to my brother. A good place to start would be with renewed Doctor Who, the episode is called Rose. It&#039;s a first episode after a long hiatus. 
<span id="time-span">19:21:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh ok. It felt a bit crazy to me, but it&#039;s probably because I didn&#039;t know the context of it all. I&#039;ll try to start there when I found some time, thanks! 
<span id="time-span">19:21:47</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>No problem. 
<span id="time-span">19:22:21</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>You said you watched youtube, what kind of videos? Or do you just let Youtube randomly waste your time like I do? 
<span id="time-span">19:23:00</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>I have my favorite channels. Some that are information filled and then some lets plays. 
<span id="time-span">19:23:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I mostly watch Minecraft related videos. Depends on my mood. 
<span id="time-span">19:24:42</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>I watch a lot of Minecraft too. Mainly a series called Trollcraft, starring my favorite, CaptainSparklez, together with Crainer and Ssundee. 
<span id="time-span">19:24:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">19:25:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">19:27:05</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>human 
<span id="time-span">19:27:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">19:27:37</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>5 
<span id="time-span">19:28:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.

<span id="time-span">19:29:57</span><span id="name-span">Takeru</span>Whichever really was artificial inteligence was pretty convincing. Good job... Should I be scared?
