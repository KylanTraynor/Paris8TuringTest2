FelixKitty,9,9,"Test ",5,
Moderator,12,3,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,22,10,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,30,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,36,6,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,42,6,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,51,9,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,57,6,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,64,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,70,6,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,77,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,85,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,91,6,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,98,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,106,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,114,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,120,6,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,125,5,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
FelixKitty,131,6,"YEs ",4,
Moderator,135,4,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
FelixKitty,143,8,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,150,7,"Hello! ",7,
FelixKitty,156,6,"Hello there! ",13,1
Andrew,168,12,"How are you doing? ",19,1
FelixKitty,175,7,"I&#039;m doing alright, how about yourself? ",44,1
Andrew,188,13,"I&#039;m doing quite alright! What are you up to? ",50,1
FelixKitty,201,13,"Nothing much right now, myself. What about you? ",48,1
Andrew,226,25,"Ah alright. I&#039;m playing a little bit of Minecraft. ",56,1
FelixKitty,249,23,"Oh nice! Up to anything neat with it? ",38,1
Andrew,272,23,"I&#039;ve been walking around in circle for a bit now. I&#039;m not sure yet. ",78,1
FelixKitty,284,12,"Trying to decide what to build? ",32,1
Andrew,314,30,"Do you play it too? Yeah pretty much. ",38,1
FelixKitty,334,20,"I do, though not as much as I used to. I haven&#039;t had the motivation to work on my projects ",96,1
Andrew,351,17,"What kind of projects? ",23,1
FelixKitty,383,32,"One&#039;s a starship, another is a light rail network, and the third one is a custom recreation of a facility from a book I read in middle school ",147,1
Andrew,433,50,"How long have you been working on those? That is pretty cool actually. ",71,1
FelixKitty,473,40,"The first two, on and off since 2013. The other one, I started late last year and haven&#039;t come very far with it ",117,1
Andrew,524,51,"That must be a very big airship. That&#039;s a lot of work then! ",65,1
FelixKitty,584,60,"Yup! And it&#039;s all been by hand, which is a huge factor of the time to build these projects. ",97,1
Andrew,618,34,"Oh yeah. There are ways to make it a lot easier. You&#039;ve never been tempted to? ",84,1
FelixKitty,649,31,"I&#039;ve been tempted, but I view it as sort of cheating the effort really. Plus, it&#039;s easier if I have to go back and redesign something. ",145,1
Andrew,701,52,"You don&#039;t play survival at all? And yeah fair enough. ",59,1
FelixKitty,752,51,"I play it here and there, but it&#039;s vanilla Minecraft when I do ",68,1
Andrew,810,58,"Do you play on a server at all? It can be quite boring. ",56,1
FelixKitty,825,15,"Not usually. Most of the time it&#039;s by myself. ",51,1
Andrew,846,21,"That might be why you have a lack of motivation. ",49,1
FelixKitty,878,32,"Maybe, but part of it is just not knowing where to go from where I&#039;m at now ",81,1
Andrew,911,33,"Do you play anything else? Yeah I see. ",39,1
FelixKitty,954,43,"Not too many other games really. I&#039;m not much of a gamer.  ",64,1
Andrew,975,21,"What do you like to be doing? ",30,1
FelixKitty,1008,33,"Mostly chatting online, or building stuff in Lego Digital Designer. ",68,1
Andrew,1043,35,"What is that? I&#039;ve never heard of it. ",43,1
Moderator,1067,24,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1087,20,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
FelixKitty,1117,30,"The Artificial Intelligence ",28,
Moderator,1124,7,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
FelixKitty,1133,9,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1138,5,"Hello! ",7,
FelixKitty,1157,19,"Hiya! ",6,2
Andrew,1169,12,"How are you doing? ",19,2
FelixKitty,1176,7,"I&#039;m alright, how about yourself? ",38,2
Andrew,1192,16,"I&#039;m doing quite alright. What are you up to? ",50,2
FelixKitty,1203,11,"Nothing too much really. What about you? ",41,2
Andrew,1242,39,"I&#039;m not doing much. I might just play a bit of Minecraft. ",63,2
FelixKitty,1262,20,"Oh? Anything in particular you might do in it? ",47,2
Andrew,1290,28,"I&#039;m not entirely sure yet actually. But I&#039;m open for ideas! ",70,2
FelixKitty,1327,37,"Well, are you playing Survival? Or creative? ",45,2
Andrew,1347,20,"I play a bit of both. I&#039;m on a server actually most of the time. ",70,2
FelixKitty,1363,16,"Oh nice. What sort of server? ",30,2
Andrew,1413,50,"It&#039;s basically a medieval themed server, and a bit of a RPG. ",66,2
FelixKitty,1431,18,"Oh, that&#039;s cool! ",22,2
Andrew,1469,38,"Yeah, it also tries to bring some creative aspect within the difficulty of survival. ",85,2
FelixKitty,1534,65,"Nice! I mostly stick to single player, myself ",46,2
Andrew,1570,36,"I find it more fun playing with others. It gets old very fast if I play on my own. ",83,2
FelixKitty,1624,54,"Fair enough. It works for me since I&#039;m usually the only one with the schematics for what I&#039;m building in my head ",123,2
Andrew,1671,47,"Yeah, it&#039;s hard working with other people. It helps being on a call at the same time. ",91,2
FelixKitty,1690,19,"Yeah, that&#039;s true. Makes it easier to coordinate ",54,2
Andrew,1721,31,"What kind of things do you like to build? Medieval buildings too? ",66,2
FelixKitty,1755,34,"Nah, mostly modern/futuristic stuff myself. ",44,2
Andrew,1783,28,"Oh I see. It can be quite cool as well, and less common. ",57,2
FelixKitty,1818,35,"Yup. Especially with mods to make things a bit easier to build ",63,2
Andrew,1881,63,"Which mods do you use? I used to like one that made you able to build ships. ",77,2
FelixKitty,1941,60,"Mostly mods to increase the capabilities of Redstone, and for aesthetic stuff. ProjectRed for example ",102,2
Andrew,1958,17,"I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard of it actually. ",51,2
FelixKitty,2019,61,"It&#039;s a good one. It gives you better components to work with, such as wire and stuff, and also lets you take a giant redstone circuit and put it into one plate. ",166,2
Andrew,2056,37,"Oh yeah it&#039;s sounds pretty cool actually! I should try it. ",64,2
Moderator,2061,5,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2084,23,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the FIRST conversation?  ",81,
FelixKitty,2095,11,"The Artificial Intelligence ",28,
Moderator,2103,8,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
FelixKitty,2125,22,"6 ",2,
Moderator,2130,5,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,
Moderator,2161,31,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise, you can now close this window. ",117,
FelixKitty,2204,43,"THe second Andrew felt more fluid, the conversation more human. The first one felt a bit choppy, and I couldn&#039;t see an actual human player just aimlessly going in circles in Minecraft. ",190,
Andrew,2225,21,"Alright! Thank you! ",20,
