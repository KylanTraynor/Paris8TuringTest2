<span id="time-span">02:40:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello 56k. 
<span id="time-span">02:40:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">02:40:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Are you able to read this? 
<span id="time-span">02:40:42</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I am. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:09</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:14</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Go for it. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:24</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">02:41:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">02:42:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">02:42:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">02:42:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] 
<span id="time-span">02:42:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">02:42:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">02:42:50</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">02:42:58</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">02:43:58</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I do. One question: should I pose my questions/statements/posts in an attempt to actively fool the AI in order to obtain a correct answer (while still maintaining normal English), or: 
<span id="time-span">02:44:06</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Have conversation flow be as natural as possible? 
<span id="time-span">02:44:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>It&#039;s up to you, as long as you talk to the character, and not the actors. 
<span id="time-span">02:44:39</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Got it. 
<span id="time-span">02:44:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">02:45:10</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I am! 
<span id="time-span">02:45:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">02:45:36</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Hi, Andrew! What a fantastic name. Could you tell me the origin of it? 
<span id="time-span">02:46:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I actually never thought about it. Well, my parents? 
<span id="time-span">02:46:33</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>What were your parents names? 
<span id="time-span">02:46:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Kyle and Olivia. 
<span id="time-span">02:47:05</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>What&#039;s the first memory you have of your mother? 
<span id="time-span">02:47:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s a good question, I&#039;m not entirely sure actually. 
<span id="time-span">02:48:06</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Makes sense! What town did you grow up in? 
<span id="time-span">02:48:44</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ontario, London. That&#039;s also where I&#039;m studying right now. 
<span id="time-span">02:49:34</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Oh neat, so you&#039;ve been there a while. How old are you, Andrew? 
<span id="time-span">02:49:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m 21. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">02:50:02</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>30, I&#039;m old. Do you think that 30 is old or that 40 is the new 20? 
<span id="time-span">02:51:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Depends on the person. Well, 30 is not that old. Some are still young at 40 and others are already old at 20. 
<span id="time-span">02:52:23</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Do you go to bars, Andrew? If so, what is your favorite drink? If you don&#039;t, what is your favorite sandwich? 
<span id="time-span">02:53:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Pizzasub. No, I don&#039;t really go to bars. 
<span id="time-span">02:54:57</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Great. Would you rather have a pizzasub with grenadine or a glass of hamburger with cocoa? 
<span id="time-span">02:56:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>A pizzasub with grenadine sounds less impossible than the other one, but neither option sound really appealing. 
<span id="time-span">02:56:36</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Yeah, I agree. By the way, I forget. How old will you be in 5 years? 
<span id="time-span">02:57:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>If I&#039;m not dead before, 26. 
<span id="time-span">02:57:32</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I understand that! Do you prefer blondes or brunettes? 
<span id="time-span">02:58:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>So brunettes. My girlfriend is a brunette. 
<span id="time-span">02:59:02</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I hear that. Does your redheaded girlfriend also like pizzasubs? 
<span id="time-span">02:59:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>She&#039;s not redheaded, I only have one girlfriend. She does though. 
<span id="time-span">03:00:13</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Great! I have one more question after this but first, do you want to ask me anything? 
<span id="time-span">03:00:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Go ahead, not really no. 
<span id="time-span">03:00:50</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>When is your birthday? 
<span id="time-span">03:00:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">03:01:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? 
<span id="time-span">03:02:26</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>If I can reserve that guess for after the second conversation I would; this actor responded sensibly to nonsensical questions and corrected me in a natural manner, but also incorrectly placed some -&gt; 
<span id="time-span">03:03:03</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>sentences and responded to questions I didn&#039;t ask. Still, I&#039;d lean 70% chance human and 30% chance  AI.
<span id="time-span">03:03:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>So, I&#039;ll take it your first answer is Human. You&#039;ll be able to change it after the second conversation. 
<span id="time-span">03:03:50</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Yep! 
<span id="time-span">03:04:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">03:04:10</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I am. 
<span id="time-span">03:04:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">03:04:38</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Hi Andrew! What a wonderful name. Where is your family from? 
<span id="time-span">03:05:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>My father&#039;s side is from Ireland, and my mother&#039;s from France. 
<span id="time-span">03:05:53</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Where is your family currently located? 
<span id="time-span">03:06:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>We live in London, Ontario. 
<span id="time-span">03:06:24</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I see! What generation of your mother&#039;s side first came to Ontario? 
<span id="time-span">03:07:12</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Her grand parents I think. 
<span id="time-span">03:07:36</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Would that be your great grandparents? 
<span id="time-span">03:07:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>By definition yes. 
<span id="time-span">03:08:07</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Andrew, what is your favorite restaurant in London? 
<span id="time-span">03:09:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I haven&#039;t really been in many restaurants, there is one next to the fields that I like but I can&#039;t remember its name. There&#039;s a minigolf right next to it though. 
<span id="time-span">03:09:14</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>What kind of food does it serve? 
<span id="time-span">03:09:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Many different things. I usually just take a burger or ribs though. 
<span id="time-span">03:10:30</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Great! If you like a fried egg on your burger, don&#039;t tell me what your favorite color is and tell me what your lucky number is. 
<span id="time-span">03:11:03</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>6. 
<span id="time-span">03:11:21</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>A good, solid number! Are you  married, or do you have a girlfriend? 
<span id="time-span">03:11:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I have a girlfriend yes. Gosh you type fast. 
<span id="time-span">03:11:52</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I&#039;m quick on the draw! 
<span id="time-span">03:11:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Right. 
<span id="time-span">03:12:22</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Have you told your girlfriend about your affair with your girlfriend? 
<span id="time-span">03:12:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>She knows about it. 
<span id="time-span">03:13:25</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Do you prefer it when the sun is blue or when the sky is boxed? 
<span id="time-span">03:14:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well I do like blue stars. But I don&#039;t think I can answer that question. 
<span id="time-span">03:14:35</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>[stop] 
<span id="time-span">03:14:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">03:15:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">03:15:50</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Do you want just the answer or my thoughts? 
<span id="time-span">03:16:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>First just the answer. 
<span id="time-span">03:16:07</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I don&#039;t want to step out of bounds. <img src='smiles/smile.gif'/>  
<span id="time-span">03:16:16</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I&#039;m going to keep banking on human. 
<span id="time-span">03:16:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">03:16:27</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Hahahahhah 
<span id="time-span">03:17:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>? 
<span id="time-span">03:17:21</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Sorry, I&#039;m thinking 
<span id="time-span">03:17:27</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I&#039;m going to go with 2 or 3 
<span id="time-span">03:17:30</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>So 2 
<span id="time-span">03:17:36</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>I&#039;m impressed either way 
<span id="time-span">03:17:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, now you can go with your thoughts 
<span id="time-span">03:19:04</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Well first, I&#039;m not convinced you don&#039;t have two humans! The second conversation tripped on the burger answer (I figure an AI would do neither, but a human could misread it) but : 
<span id="time-span">03:19:20</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>also tripped on the girlfriend answer (not &quot;How can I have an affair with the same person? or &quot;I&#039;m not having an affair.&quot;). 
<span id="time-span">03:19:55</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Given I&#039;m not an expert with AI but that&#039;s how I figure it would go, knowing more about human communication (it&#039;s my field) than AI 
<span id="time-span">03:20:40</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Still, the first one dealt better with non-sequitur and nonsensical questions, thus my answer, but I have a distinct gut feeling I&#039;m wrong 
<span id="time-span">03:20:44</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>That concludes my thoughts 
<span id="time-span">03:21:04</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Do I get to know if I was correct? 
<span id="time-span">03:21:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>What was that burger answer thing in the 2nd conversation? 
<span id="time-span">03:21:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>oh, with the fried egg. 
<span id="time-span">03:22:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright, so I&#039;ll tell you the answer, give me a second 
<span id="time-span">03:22:56</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Sure thing. Given, I&#039;m not an expert on AI or fooling them or particularly think I&#039;m clever! ;) 
<span id="time-span">03:23:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The first conversation was with the machine! 
<span id="time-span">03:23:19</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Haha, I&#039;ll be damn. 
<span id="time-span">03:23:25</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>That&#039;s very convincing. 
<span id="time-span">03:23:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I&#039;m curious though, what was wrong with the burger and the girlfriend in your opinion? 
<span id="time-span">03:24:06</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>(this is not a part of the experiment, I&#039;m just curious) 
<span id="time-span">03:25:16</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Absolutely. Well, prefacing this again with &quot;I am not a smart man&quot;, my attempt was to get a non-fried egg loving AI to say &quot;I don&#039;t like fried egg, so I shouldn&#039;t tell him what my favorite color OR 
<span id="time-span">03:25:35</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>my lucky number.&quot; 
<span id="time-span">03:26:22</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>With the girlfriend, &quot;Is your girlfriend aware of the affair you&#039;re having with your girlfriend&quot; is entrapping and also nonsensical--&quot;Yes&quot; implies you&#039;re having an affair and she knows, &quot;No&quot; implies 
<span id="time-span">03:27:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>For the burger you said &quot;if you like a fried egg on your burger, don&#039;t tell me your favorite color and tell me your lucky number.&quot; So what I assume happened was that he considered he liked a fried egg
<span id="time-span">03:27:23</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>you&#039;re having an affair and she doesn&#039;t know--but you can&#039;t have an affair with your own girlfriend, on your own girlfriend (I didn&#039;t specify other girlfriend), either way. 
<span id="time-span">03:27:49</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>So, I figured that a human would either respond with a confused answer or deny the affair (thus falling for the joke). 
<span id="time-span">03:28:11</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>The response was   which pretty much sealed the deal for me, in my mind
<span id="time-span">03:28:43</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>That&#039;s no problem; it definitely wasn&#039;t a sure thing on the hamburger; that&#039;s just my thought process on it. 
<span id="time-span">03:29:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>And for the girlfriend part, I got the confirmation that he just answered with humor, saying that if he was having an affair with his own girlfriend, then she&#039;d know about it. 
<span id="time-span">03:29:44</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>(And he should, because only a filthy robot-loving AI wouldn&#039;t like fried egg--if he liked fried egg as an AI, my thought process was that he wouldn&#039;t answer at all or dodge the question) 
<span id="time-span">03:30:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Oh ok ^^ 
<span id="time-span">03:30:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Well anyways, thanks a lot for your help ^^ 
<span id="time-span">03:30:43</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Totally! It just tripped my sensors. Either way, very impressive and you&#039;re very welcome. <img src='smiles/smile.gif'/> 
<span id="time-span">03:30:45</span><span id="name-span">56k</span>Good luck with the study! 
<span id="time-span">03:31:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thanks! You can now close this window.
