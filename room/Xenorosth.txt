<span id="time-span">23:25:50</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Morning. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Xenorosth. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:14</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Evening. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:31</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:40</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">23:26:51</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Okay.  
<span id="time-span">23:26:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:29</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:37</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:37</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Understood.  
<span id="time-span">23:27:46</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">23:27:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:19</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:20</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Can I use any methods I want? 
<span id="time-span">23:28:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Yes you can. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:40</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Gotcha. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:44</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">23:28:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">23:28:59</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">23:28:59</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Can I try to trick the AI? 
<span id="time-span">23:29:15</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You can try as long as you respect the rules above. 
<span id="time-span">23:29:26</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Okay. Will do. 
<span id="time-span">23:29:30</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:29:36</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Ready 
<span id="time-span">23:29:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:29:45</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Evening. How are you? 
<span id="time-span">23:29:57</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright! What about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:30:39</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Well enough. Just curious, are you good at math? 
<span id="time-span">23:30:52</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ugh to some extent I guess. Why? 
<span id="time-span">23:31:17</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>I&#039;m doing calculus.  
<span id="time-span">23:31:34</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh that&#039;s cool! I study Biology. 
<span id="time-span">23:31:51</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>What type? 
<span id="time-span">23:32:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Human Biology, and hopefully Neurobiology next year. 
<span id="time-span">23:32:31</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>What&#039;s the difference? 
<span id="time-span">23:33:05</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, Human Biology is about the whole body. Neurobiology only focuses on the neural system. 
<span id="time-span">23:33:26</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Cotton candy? 
<span id="time-span">23:33:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Ugh? 
<span id="time-span">23:34:45</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Never mind. Tell me what do you know about human biology? Have you gone into mitochondria?  
<span id="time-span">23:36:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, of course I have, doesn&#039;t everyone learn at least a bit about the mitochondria though? Don&#039;t need to be in Biology to know that. Do you have a more specific question though? 
<span id="time-span">23:37:39</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Nah. What do you know about neurons? 
<span id="time-span">23:39:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, they are structured around 3 main parts. The dentritic tree, the axon and the stoma. They are also one of the very few cells that you can keep for your entire life. 
<span id="time-span">23:39:43</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>I think I&#039;m done. I need no more information with this Andrew. 
<span id="time-span">23:39:55</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation Interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">23:40:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">23:40:21</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>The AI. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">23:40:32</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Yes. 
<span id="time-span">23:40:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">23:40:58</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Evening. How are you? 
<span id="time-span">23:41:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing quite alright! What about you? 
<span id="time-span">23:41:42</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Well enough. What are you working on recently? 
<span id="time-span">23:42:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly studying for the coming exams. 
<span id="time-span">23:42:13</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>What exams do you have? 
<span id="time-span">23:42:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Cellular Biology, Anatomy, Chemistry and Physiology. 
<span id="time-span">23:43:11</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>How good are you at math? 
<span id="time-span">23:43:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m alright I guess? Depends. 
<span id="time-span">23:43:47</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>How about Calculus? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:11</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, it depends really. 
<span id="time-span">23:44:36</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Do you like math? 
<span id="time-span">23:44:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I do yes. From far away. 
<span id="time-span">23:45:07</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>From far away? 
<span id="time-span">23:45:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yup. 
<span id="time-span">23:45:23</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>From far away? 
<span id="time-span">23:45:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well yeah? 
<span id="time-span">23:45:55</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Why the question mark?  
<span id="time-span">23:46:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well I&#039;m wondering what you mean. 
<span id="time-span">23:46:44</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Explain. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:01</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Explain what? Mind elaborating a little bit? 
<span id="time-span">23:47:18</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Explain your last statement please. 
<span id="time-span">23:47:50</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t really see what you don&#039;t understand in it. It seems pretty obvious to me. 
<span id="time-span">23:48:42</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Stop the convo. This one is more likely to be the AI. 
<span id="time-span">23:48:52</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Conversation interrupted! 
<span id="time-span">23:49:02</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">23:49:11</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Human. 
<span id="time-span">23:49:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">23:49:27</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>5 
<span id="time-span">23:49:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">23:49:48</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Who was who? Was I right? 
<span id="time-span">23:49:49</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">23:50:02</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Or am I not allowed to know? 
<span id="time-span">23:50:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>I can give you the answer after you give comments, if you decide to give any. Otherwise I can tell you now. 
<span id="time-span">23:51:20</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Well, in conversation two, it&#039;s a common thing for robots to have a feature that makes an &quot;excuse&quot; for not being able to elaborate. The actor is VERY good at simulating certain actions an AI might do.
<span id="time-span">23:52:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Is this all? 
<span id="time-span">23:53:08</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>I think the last thing is that there is a slightly situation where it&#039;s very clear &quot;Andrew&quot; either coded the robot, or has access to what he&#039;d say, considering the mimicked approach.  
<span id="time-span">23:53:17</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>That&#039;s all. 
<span id="time-span">23:53:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. You were correct. The actual human was the first conversation. 
<span id="time-span">23:54:16</span><span id="name-span">Xenorosth</span>Thanks. Enjoyed it. Closing the window!
