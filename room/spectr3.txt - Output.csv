Moderator,60,33,"First, do you see those messages? ",34,
spectr3,71,11,"sure ",5,
Moderator,77,6,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,86,9,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,96,10,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,104,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,111,7,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,120,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
spectr3,122,2,"talking or chatting? ",21,

Moderator,167,8,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,173,6,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,

spectr3,1860,50,"That&#039;s what a good AI would say! ",38,2
Andrew,1873,13,"That&#039;s also what a human would say isn&#039;t it? ",55,2
spectr3,1889,16,"but this isn&#039;t about the AI, it&#039;s about the game. It&#039;s just a story that you both know how to tell in different ways. ",133,2
