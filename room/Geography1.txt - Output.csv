Moderator,0,0,"Welcome Geography1! ",20,
Moderator,4,4,"Thank you for participating in this study! ",43,
Moderator,14,10,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Geography1,20,6,"I&#039;m curious to see how it works,  and yes, I can read this. ",65,
Moderator,33,13,"Alright. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",113,
Moderator,41,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,58,17,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,66,8,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,78,12,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,86,8,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,93,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,100,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,107,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,114,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,122,8,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,131,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,138,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,145,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,153,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,160,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Geography1,165,5,"Yes, I do. ",11,
Moderator,170,5,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Geography1,174,4,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,186,12,"Hello! ",7,
Geography1,193,7,"Hello to you as well. ",22,1
Andrew,201,8,"How are you doing? ",19,1
Geography1,209,8,"I&#039;m doing well, thanks. ",29,1
Andrew,229,20,"Cool! What are you up to today? ",32,1
Geography1,248,19,"I&#039;m browsing the internet, stumbled across this and it seemed interesting. ",80,1
Andrew,283,35,"I take It you&#039;re interested by AI stuff in general? ",57,1
Geography1,370,87,"I&#039;ve seen fictional portrayals.  Things like HAL in the movie 2001.   Often they get used as a literal Deus Ex Machina for the plot of a story, or to reflect a kind of Pandora&#039;s Box type story.   ",206,1
Andrew,464,94,"Yeah, most of the time they are portrayed as evil things that should be destroyed. Also more recently as things that could be useful like Jarvis in Iron Man. What&#039;s your take on that? ",189,1
Geography1,560,96,"I only saw the first two movies.  I thought he seemed sub-sentient in that situation.   Certainly Tony Stark treated him that way.  I didn&#039;t find his character to be that important to the plot. ",199,1
Andrew,631,71,"Yeah he seemed to be intelligent, but not really an individual entity. More like a super developed Siri. Do you play games? Mass Effect has a very interesting take on all of this. ",180,1
Geography1,725,94,"Kind of...  Mass Effect at least managed to say that digital life could be as diverse as biological life, except for when it&#039;s primary villians declared that it must always rebel against its creators.",205,1
Andrew,807,82,"Yeah, the ending was a bit weird in that sense. Didn&#039;t really fit with the rest of the story. ",99,1
Geography1,829,22,"Multiple writers, multiple visions.  It happens. ",49,1
Andrew,850,21,"Happened with the last one too, in one single game. ",52,1
Geography1,876,26,"Haven&#039;t played that one yet.  My game budget has diminished since I had kids. ",83,1
Andrew,908,32,"Yeah I can imagine. Probably less time too. How many kids do you have? ",71,1
Geography1,955,47,"Two,  one of each gender.  It&#039;s early here so I get a little free time before they wake. ",94,1
Andrew,1009,54,"Yeah, it&#039;s 9:17 here. I&#039;m in Canada. You? ",52,1
Geography1,1060,51,"West Coast US.   I wondered given the fact the &quot;Universite&quot; is French.  Quebec? ",90,1
Andrew,1087,27,"No, that university has little to do with me personally. I&#039;m just helping. ",80,1
Moderator,1105,18,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1121,16,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Geography1,1126,5,"Human. ",7,
Moderator,1137,11,"Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? ",141,
Geography1,1144,7,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,1149,5,"Hello! ",7,
Geography1,1187,38,"Good Morning. ",14,2
Andrew,1198,11,"How are you doing? ",19,2
Geography1,1207,9,"I&#039;m doing quite fine,  how about you? ",43,2
Andrew,1225,18,"What are you up to today? I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks. ",63,2
Geography1,1271,46,"Just browsing the internet, came across this and I was curious to see what the differences might be and if an AI could pass a Turing test. ",139,2
Andrew,1343,72,"You seem to have some knowledge about that. I take it you&#039;re interested in AI? ",84,2
Geography1,1378,35,"Some knowledge yes.    Not much beyond the most basic ideas and what&#039;s been in some movies or books.  HAL from 2001 for example. ",134,2
Andrew,1462,84,"I watched it a few months ago though. I only have few memories of this movie actually. ",87,2
Geography1,1533,71,"Oh?   That few memories sounds a little like the kind of conversational dodge an AI would use to avoid detailed questions that require human context. ",150,2
Andrew,1636,103,"Or it could just be that it didn&#039;t really grab my attention that much. Kind of like 2001: The Space Odyssey. ",114,2
Geography1,1734,98,"It&#039;s also a very long movie.  They don&#039;t make them with specific seating music and an intermission anymore. ",118,2
Andrew,1842,108,"Although both had very interesting technical features, It just seemed very slow and a bit boring. ",98,2
Geography1,1912,70,"[STOP] ",7,2
Moderator,1932,20,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,1953,21,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Geography1,1960,7,"Human ",6,
Moderator,1967,7,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? ",89,
Geography1,1970,3,"6 ",2,
Moderator,1978,8,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,1984,6,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  ",118,
