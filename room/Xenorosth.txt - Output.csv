Xenorosth,0,0,"Morning. ",9,
Moderator,11,11,"Welcome Xenorosth. ",19,
Xenorosth,24,13,"Evening. ",9,
Moderator,41,17,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,50,9,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Xenorosth,61,11,"Okay.  ",7,
Moderator,63,2,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,71,8,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,78,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,90,12,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,99,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,107,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Xenorosth,107,0,"Understood.  ",13,
Moderator,116,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,123,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,132,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,142,10,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,149,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Xenorosth,150,1,"Can I use any methods I want? ",30,
Moderator,155,5,"Yes you can. ",13,
Moderator,163,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Xenorosth,170,7,"Gotcha. ",8,
Moderator,174,4,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,181,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,189,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Xenorosth,189,0,"Can I try to trick the AI? ",27,
Moderator,205,16,"You can try as long as you respect the rules above. ",52,
Xenorosth,216,11,"Okay. Will do. ",15,
Moderator,220,4,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Xenorosth,226,6,"Ready ",6,
Andrew,229,3,"Hello! ",7,
Xenorosth,235,6,"Evening. How are you? ",22,1
Andrew,247,12,"I&#039;m doing quite alright! What about you? ",46,1
Xenorosth,289,42,"Well enough. Just curious, are you good at math? ",49,1
Andrew,302,13,"Ugh to some extent I guess. Why? ",33,1
Xenorosth,327,25,"I&#039;m doing calculus.  ",26,1
Andrew,344,17,"Oh that&#039;s cool! I study Biology. ",38,1
Xenorosth,361,17,"What type? ",11,1
Andrew,386,25,"Human Biology, and hopefully Neurobiology next year. ",53,1
Xenorosth,401,15,"What&#039;s the difference? ",28,1
Andrew,435,34,"Well, Human Biology is about the whole body. Neurobiology only focuses on the neural system. ",93,1
Xenorosth,456,21,"Cotton candy? ",14,1
Andrew,476,20,"Ugh? ",5,1
Xenorosth,535,59,"Never mind. Tell me what do you know about human biology? Have you gone into mitochondria?  ",92,1
Andrew,630,95,"Well, of course I have, doesn&#039;t everyone learn at least a bit about the mitochondria though? Don&#039;t need to be in Biology to know that. Do you have a more specific question though? ",190,1
Xenorosth,709,79,"Nah. What do you know about neurons? ",37,1
Andrew,806,97,"Well, they are structured around 3 main parts. The dentritic tree, the axon and the stoma. They are also one of the very few cells that you can keep for your entire life. ",171,1
Xenorosth,833,27,"I think I&#039;m done. I need no more information with this Andrew. ",68,1
Moderator,845,12,"Conversation Interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,860,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
Xenorosth,871,11,"The AI. ",8,
Moderator,877,6,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
Xenorosth,882,5,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,885,3,"Hello! ",7,
Xenorosth,908,23,"Evening. How are you? ",22,2
Andrew,924,16,"I&#039;m doing quite alright! What about you? ",46,2
Xenorosth,952,28,"Well enough. What are you working on recently? ",47,2
Andrew,970,18,"Mostly studying for the coming exams. ",38,2
Xenorosth,983,13,"What exams do you have? ",24,2
Andrew,1016,33,"Cellular Biology, Anatomy, Chemistry and Physiology. ",53,2
Xenorosth,1041,25,"How good are you at math? ",26,2
Andrew,1065,24,"I&#039;m alright I guess? Depends. ",35,2
Xenorosth,1077,12,"How about Calculus? ",20,2
Andrew,1101,24,"Well, it depends really. ",25,2
Xenorosth,1126,25,"Do you like math? ",18,2
Andrew,1141,15,"I do yes. From far away. ",25,2
Xenorosth,1157,16,"From far away? ",15,2
Andrew,1165,8,"Yup. ",5,2
Xenorosth,1173,8,"From far away? ",15,2
Andrew,1185,12,"Well yeah? ",11,2
Xenorosth,1205,20,"Why the question mark?  ",24,2
Andrew,1235,30,"Well I&#039;m wondering what you mean. ",39,2
Xenorosth,1254,19,"Explain. ",9,2
Andrew,1271,17,"Explain what? Mind elaborating a little bit? ",45,2
Xenorosth,1288,17,"Explain your last statement please. ",36,2
Andrew,1320,32,"I don&#039;t really see what you don&#039;t understand in it. It seems pretty obvious to me. ",93,2
Xenorosth,1372,52,"Stop the convo. This one is more likely to be the AI. ",54,2
Moderator,1382,10,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,1392,10,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Xenorosth,1401,9,"Human. ",7,
Moderator,1404,3,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Xenorosth,1417,13,"5 ",2,
Moderator,1424,7,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,
Xenorosth,1438,14,"Who was who? Was I right? ",26,
Moderator,1439,1,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window. ",116,
Xenorosth,1452,13,"Or am I not allowed to know? ",29,
Moderator,1464,12,"I can give you the answer after you give comments, if you decide to give any. Otherwise I can tell you now. ",108,
Xenorosth,1530,66,"Well, in conversation two, it&#039;s a common thing for robots to have a feature that makes an &quot;excuse&quot; for not being able to elaborate. The actor is VERY good at simulating certain actions an AI might do.",215,
Moderator,1584,54,"Is this all? ",13,
Xenorosth,1638,54,"I think the last thing is that there is a slightly situation where it&#039;s very clear &quot;Andrew&quot; either coded the robot, or has access to what he&#039;d say, considering the mimicked approach.  ",204,
Xenorosth,1647,9,"That&#039;s all. ",17,
Moderator,1672,25,"Alright. You were correct. The actual human was the first conversation. ",72,
Xenorosth,1706,34,"Thanks. Enjoyed it. Closing the window! ",40,
