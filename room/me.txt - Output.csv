Moderator,0,0,"Hello me. ",10,
me,193,193,"...hello? ",10,
Moderator,207,14,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,235,28,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,247,12,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,270,23,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,274,4,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,285,11,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,308,23,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,318,10,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,330,12,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,341,11,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,352,11,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,363,11,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,377,14,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,392,15,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,400,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,409,9,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,418,9,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
me,424,6,"I do understand. ",17,
Moderator,439,15,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. ",87,
Andrew,457,18,"Hello! ",7,
me,468,11,"Hi there. ",10,1
Andrew,476,8,"How are you? ",13,1
me,496,20,"I&#039;m alright.  Are you? ",28,1
Andrew,509,13,"I am yes. What are you up to? ",30,1
me,544,35,"Other than talking to you?  Looking out of the window longingly at Spring, wishing I could be outside.  Is it warm where you are, too? ",135,1
Andrew,589,45,"Not really no. But it&#039;s decent. ",37,1
me,626,37,"So it&#039;s not sunny, but it&#039;s not raining either? ",58,1
Andrew,665,39,"It&#039;s just mostly cloudy, yeah. 51&deg;F. ",46,1
me,719,54,"Have other people that have spoken to you today also asked about the weather? ",78,1
Andrew,778,59,"Not really no. Haven&#039;t been talking to many people yet. ",61,1
me,800,22,"How far through our time do you think we are? ",46,1
Andrew,840,40,"Something like 5 minutes? I don&#039;t really know. ",52,1
me,876,36,"I&#039;ve never been good at judging time. ",43,1
Andrew,931,55,"Question of rhythm I guess. Where do you live? ",47,1
me,974,43,"I live right on the edge of London.  At least, according to most people, living right by the circular motorway that goes around London is the edge of &#039;real London&#039;. ",175,1
Andrew,1034,60,"Are you from the UK London? I live in London too, though not in the same country I imagine. ",92,1
me,1045,11,"Yes, the UK London. ",20,1
Andrew,1056,11,"Canadian one here. ",19,1
me,1084,28,"I&#039;m sure there are plenty of internet articles arguing over which London is better. ",89,1
Andrew,1113,29,"There is little to do in mine.  I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s your London.",75,1
me,1136,23,"I guess that&#039;s true.  Only one of them is a capital. ",58,1
Andrew,1179,43,"Right. What do you do for work? Or are you a student? ",54,1
me,1199,20,"I work in Cybersecurity.  I protect organisations from malicious threat actors. ",80,1
Andrew,1221,22,"Oh I see. Do you think I&#039;m one of those? ",46,1
me,1235,14,"Depends, are you trying to exfiltrate money from banks? ",56,1
Andrew,1273,38,"In my past life, I&#039;ve tried. It didn&#039;t succeed. T hat&#039;s why it was my past life.",95,1
me,1297,24,"If you had succeeded, you&#039;d have spent some time in jail and then you&#039;d have probably still considered it a past life. ",129,1
Andrew,1318,21,"That&#039;s true enough I guess yeah. ",38,1
me,1357,39,"Can you remind me of what your weather was like? ",49,1
Andrew,1372,15,"Mostly cloudy. ",15,1
Moderator,1380,8,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1395,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
me,1401,6,"Human. ",7,
Moderator,1440,39,"Alright. The next conversation is about to begin. Andrew will start, and you&#039;ll have 15 minutes maximum after you answer. ",127,
Andrew,1453,13,"Hello! ",7,
me,1467,14,"Hi there.  How are you doing today? ",36,2
Andrew,1478,11,"I&#039;m doing alright. What about you? ",40,2
me,1496,18,"I&#039;ve had better days. ",27,2
Andrew,1507,11,"Something wrong? ",17,2
me,1527,20,"I just wish I was able to be outside is all. ",45,2
Andrew,1542,15,"Maybe you should do that then. ",31,2
me,1554,12,"Oh, but then I&#039;d miss out on talking to you. ",50,2
Andrew,1569,15,"And that would be such a shame! ",32,2
me,1583,14,"So now do you see why I can&#039;t be outside? ",47,2
Andrew,1610,27,"I&#039;m the only thing keeping you in? Don&#039;t worry it shouldn&#039;t stay like that for too long then. ",109,2
me,1644,34,"Answering your questions is what is keeping me in. ",51,2
Andrew,1683,39,"Is it that nice outside? Can&#039;t say it is great where I am. ",64,2
me,1712,29,"It&#039;s nice enough for me to want to be. ",44,2
Andrew,1772,60,"I see. What do you do outside? Just enjoy the sun? ",51,2
me,1801,29,"I have some things to buy. ",27,2
Andrew,1823,22,"That doesn&#039;t sound as relaxing as I expected. ",51,2
me,1843,20,"Some people might prefer it. ",29,2
Andrew,1906,63,"Whenever there&#039;s some decent weather, I just find a patch of grass and relax. Or sit on the balcony. ",106,2
me,1951,45,"I don&#039;t have a balcony.  I&#039;d like to find a place to buy that has one, though.  There&#039;s a lot of stresses in life that could absolutely be solved by sitting out and just staring at the horizon for a b",215,2
me,1956,5,"it ",3,2
Andrew,1987,31,"With a cup of tea in your hand. ",32,2
me,2033,46,"Sounds nice. ",13,2
Andrew,2060,27,"It&#039;s been months since the last time I did it. ",52,2
me,2077,17,"When did you last do it? ",25,2
Andrew,2107,30,"The beginning of September, when it was still warm outside. ",60,2
me,2110,3,"How much of it did you do?  Just the tea? ",42,2
Andrew,2123,13,"Sorry what? ",12,2
me,2161,38,"How much of that idyllic scene we spoke about did you manage to do? ",68,2
Andrew,2225,64,"Well, last time I did it, it was on my balcony with some peppermint tea. Can&#039;t say the horizon was great to look at, but... Is that what you asked? ",153,2
me,2243,18,"Yeah.  Sounds beautiful.  How long through the time do you think we are? ",73,2
Andrew,2264,21,"Been a while. I&#039;d say we should be almost done. ",53,2
me,2277,13,"And then I might get to go outside. ",36,2
Andrew,2293,16,"What do you want to buy by the way? ",36,2
me,2323,30,"Maybe some peppermint tea. ",27,2
Andrew,2341,18,"Sounds like idea theft. ",24,2
me,2373,32,"Tastes like peppermint tea. ",28,2
Moderator,2373,0,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2388,15,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
me,2403,15,"I&#039;ve changed my mind.  I think the first one was the AI now. ",66,
Moderator,2418,15,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how comfident are you of your answer? ",90,
me,2424,6,"5. ",3,
Moderator,2439,15,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",168,
Moderator,2481,42,"You can give some comments, or close this window if you&#039;re done. ",70,
me,2517,36,"I started off thinking that the first one was human because it felt like a human pretending to be AI.  It felt like you had set them rules for how to talk (predominantly two sentences maximum). ",194,
me,2529,12,"However, thinking back on it, I wasn&#039;t overly complex with how I questioned the first. ",92,
me,2550,21,"When I spoke to the second, I was trying very hard to force the actor to use context to talk to me.  Use things from previous sentences and previous lines. ",156,
me,2584,34,"I noticed there was more complexity and variety in their speech, and even when I said slightly more vague or unintelligible things, I got back a more human response (sorry what? )",179,
Moderator,2641,57,"Alright. Thank you again for participating. You can now close this window. ",75,
me,2642,1,"As such, I believe the first was dealing with sentences in a formulaic manner, and the second was being more adventurous with their responses. ",143,
