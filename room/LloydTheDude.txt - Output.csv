Moderator,0,0,"Welcome LloydTheDude ",21,
Moderator,30,30,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
LloydTheDude,31,1,"Hello! ",7,
LloydTheDude,35,4,"You&#039;re welcome ",20,
Moderator,41,6,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,47,6,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,53,6,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,59,6,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,67,8,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,73,6,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,81,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,88,7,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,94,6,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,104,10,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,110,6,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,118,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,126,8,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,133,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,140,7,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,147,7,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
LloydTheDude,152,5,"Yes I do. ",10,
Moderator,158,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
LloydTheDude,163,5,"Yes! ",5,
Andrew,174,11,"Hello! ",7,
LloydTheDude,185,11,"Hi there! Are you Andrew? ",26,1
Andrew,199,14,"Well yes! How are you doing? ",29,1
LloydTheDude,214,15,"I&#039;m doing quite well, thank you for asking. How about yourself? ",69,1
Andrew,228,14,"I&#039;m doing quite alright thanks! What are you up to? ",57,1
LloydTheDude,252,24,"I was just playing some Overwatch on my PS4. Now I&#039;m thinking about a movie. Doing anything exciting yourself today? ",122,1
Andrew,295,43,"Kind of. I&#039;ve been playing a bit of Minecraft. I&#039;ve never touched Overwatch yet, is it on PC? ",104,1
LloydTheDude,314,19,"It is, but I don&#039;t have a PC. Do you play anything else? ",62,1
Andrew,347,33,"I mostly just play Minecraft, but lately I&#039;ve been very much into Mass Effect too. ",88,1
LloydTheDude,358,11,"Andromeda? I heard it got some bad reviews. ",44,1
Andrew,392,34,"It definitely did. It&#039;s still a pretty good game in my opinion. They just need to fix all the glitches and various weirdness. ",131,1
LloydTheDude,412,20,"I&#039;m going to wait til next year before I buy it; give them ample chance to fix it. ",88,1
Andrew,431,19,"That&#039;s probably a very good idea yeah. ",44,1
LloydTheDude,449,18,"So what else do you do for fun, Andrew? ",40,1
Andrew,468,19,"I mostly just play games honestly. What about you? ",51,1
LloydTheDude,506,38,"The same frankly. I watch some TV too, mostly science-fiction. ",63,1
Andrew,552,46,"Oh yeah. I do that too. I don&#039;t know of many good Sci-Fi TV shows though. ",79,1
LloydTheDude,576,24,"What do you watch? ",19,1
Andrew,617,41,"Game of Thrones and shows like that. I&#039;m eagerly waiting for the next season. ",83,1
LloydTheDude,637,20,"What are your predictions for what will happen? ",48,1
Andrew,662,25,"In what way? ",13,1
LloydTheDude,685,23,"Well with the characters, do you predict any big fights or drama between anyone? ",81,1
Andrew,714,29,"I&#039;m sure there will definitely be some fighting going on yeah. ",68,1
LloydTheDude,754,40,"Do you think Cersei will survive the season? ",45,1
Andrew,823,69,"I&#039;m not sure. I could see her die very early in the new season, or in the 9th episode. I don&#039;t think she&#039;ll be in the final season though, and if she is, not for long. ",183,1
LloydTheDude,838,15,"Who do you think will kill her? ",32,1
Andrew,872,34,"I&#039;m not really sure to be honest. ",39,1
LloydTheDude,898,26,"I think I&#039;ve got enough from this Andrew. ",47,1
Moderator,909,11,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,919,10,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) ",85,
LloydTheDude,926,7,"I think that was the AI. ",25,
Moderator,934,8,"Alright. We&#039;ll start the next conversation. Andrew will begin and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",138,
LloydTheDude,939,5,"Yes ",4,
Andrew,945,6,"Hello! ",7,
LloydTheDude,954,9,"Hi Andrew, how&#039;s it going buddy? ",38,2
Andrew,965,11,"It&#039;s going alright! What about you? ",41,2
LloydTheDude,983,18,"Not too bad, thank you. Been doing anything cool today? ",56,2
Andrew,1003,20,"Not a whole lot. Mostly playing games actually. You? ",53,2
LloydTheDude,1015,12,"Much of the same. Playing anything good? ",41,2
Andrew,1039,24,"Mostly Minecraft actually. Although I&#039;ve been very much into Mass Effect lately. ",86,2
LloydTheDude,1051,12,"How are you finding Mass Effect? ",33,2
Andrew,1099,48,"Andromeda? It&#039;s quite good honestly. I&#039;ve spent so much time on it. The glitches and lack of good facial animations are really annoying though. But they are trying to fix that. ",187,2
LloydTheDude,1123,24,"I heard as much, gonna be a while before I buy it though. Do much else when you&#039;re not playing games? ",107,2
Andrew,1166,43,"Other than that I&#039;m mostly working on college stuff. ",58,2
LloydTheDude,1178,12,"What are you studying for? ",27,2
Andrew,1207,29,"I&#039;m an undergrad. I study Biology. Are you in college too? ",64,2

Andrew,1257,35,"That is pretty cool actually. What do you do now? ",50,2
LloydTheDude,1279,22,"I work in a call centre; I help business clients manage their energy and utility consumption. ",94,2
Andrew,1304,25,"That is quite different. ",25,2
LloydTheDude,1320,16,"Yeah, not many jobs in a lot of graduate fields these days. ",60,2
Andrew,1354,34,"Yeah that&#039;s quite a shame. In which country do you live? ",62,2
LloydTheDude,1381,27,"I&#039;m from England. Can&#039;t say I&#039;m proud of that but it is what it is. ",83,2
Andrew,1397,16,"Why wouldn&#039;t you be proud of it? ",38,2
LloydTheDude,1410,13,"It&#039;s a country of morons and narcissists and closet racists.  ",67,2
Andrew,1447,37,"Well, I&#039;m sure the French would agree, but I&#039;m sure not everyone is like that. I mean, you&#039;re not so... ",119,2
LloydTheDude,1462,15,"I think I&#039;ve got enough from this Andrew. ",47,2
Moderator,1473,11,"Conversation interrupted! ",26,
Moderator,1483,10,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
