Moderator,29,29,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,39,10,"If you can see this, please say &quot;yes&quot;. ",49,
Metla,45,6,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,51,6,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,59,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,69,10,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,78,9,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,89,11,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,98,9,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,106,8,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,115,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,123,8,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,132,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,140,8,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,147,7,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. ",77,
Moderator,156,9,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,

Andrew,1263,20,"I&#039;m doing quite alright. What&#039;s up? ",46,2
Metla,1296,33,"Nothing just chilling, and chatting with you, what are you up to? ",66,2

Andrew,1433,62,"Actually I mistook it for another band, nevermind. I just know the name. I&#039;ve probably heard some of their songs but I can&#039;t recall any. ",147,2
Metla,1515,82,"You probably have heard sometimes &quot;Enter Sandman&quot; and &quot;Nothing else matters&quot;, but you don&#039;t know that metallica has  written them",154,2
Andrew,1548,33,"That&#039;s probably the case yes. I mistook it with Cascada, but that&#039;s really not the same style. ",105,2
Metla,1652,104,"They are... totally the opposite, sort of ",42,2
Andrew,1674,22,"Yeah I know. Does Cascada even still exist? ",44,2
Metla,1689,15,"I don&#039;t think so ",22,2
Andrew,1722,33,"That might explain why I&#039;ve only ever heard one song of them. Have you ever heard some symphonic metal? ",109,2

Metla,1969,33,"What have you heard of it? ",27,2

Metla,2067,53,"What about you, tell me about your favourite games and why they can be called as such ",86,2
Andrew,2116,49,"Minecraft eats a lot of my time. I love building things in it. And Mass Effect lately, mostly for the depth of the characters in it. ",133,2
Moderator,2126,10,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,2137,11,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
