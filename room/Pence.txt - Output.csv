Moderator,0,0,"Hello Pence. ",13,
Moderator,6,6,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,19,13,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Pence,20,1,"Hello, and you&#039;re welcome. ",32,
Pence,29,9,"Yes. ",5,
Moderator,33,4,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,43,10,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,55,12,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,68,13,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,78,10,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,88,10,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,97,9,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,108,11,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,117,9,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,126,9,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,134,8,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,142,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,149,7,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,157,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,166,9,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,174,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Pence,265,91,"I understand the rules. I have to chat with Andrew, a fictive character played by either a human being or an A.I for 15 minutes twice.  ",136,
Moderator,278,13,"That is correct. ",17,
Pence,308,30,"After that, I&#039;ll have to guess who is human and who is the I.A ",68,
Moderator,339,31,"That is correct too. Remember, no smiley, no link, and one post at a time. ",75,
Pence,362,23,"Understood. ",12,
Moderator,374,12,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Pence,393,19,"I am. ",6,
Andrew,414,21,"Hello! ",7,
Pence,426,12,"Hello ! How are you ? ",22,1
Andrew,437,11,"I&#039;m doing well! How about you? ",36,1
Pence,487,50,"I&#039;m doing fine ! A rainy day in France, but it&#039;s alright.  ",69,1
Andrew,507,20,"Oh you live in France! That&#039;s cool. I&#039;m in Canada. ",61,1
Pence,559,52,"Canada ? That&#039;s cool too ! How&#039;s the weather there ?  ",64,1
Andrew,599,40,"It&#039;s quite alright right now. Nice and sunny! ",51,1
Pence,679,80,"Yeah, I heard that spring and summer there can be quite warm, despite the cold winters. If I may ask: How old are you ? ",120,1
Andrew,710,31,"Yeah. Freezing winters and very hot summers. I&#039;m 21! You? ",63,1
Pence,789,79,"23 ! So I guess you&#039;re in college right now ? ",51,1
Andrew,817,28,"Yes I am. I&#039;m in my 3rd year of undergrad. I study Biology. ",65,1
Pence,905,88,"Interesting. I tried college too but I kind of failed at it. ",61,1
Andrew,919,14,"Oh? What did you study? ",24,1
Pence,989,70,"Linguistics, litterature, translation, that kind of stuff. I would have tried Biology if I wasn&#039;t so bad at mathematics. ",126,1
Andrew,1050,61,"Honestly you don&#039;t need that much math in Biology. All that sounds great though, do you like it? ",102,1
Pence,1171,121,"I did, when I was still studying it.  ",38,1
Andrew,1188,17,"Right. What are you doing now? ",31,1
Pence,1252,64,"Watching Roland Garros. Maybe you know about it ? ",50,1
Andrew,1272,20,"I do yes! Isn&#039;t it some Tennis thing, ",43,1
Moderator,1336,64,"Time is up! ",12,
Pence,1353,17,"Okay.  ",7,
Moderator,1357,4,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Pence,1394,37,"Do I have to answer already ? I have a few theories, but I have to confirm them first.  ",88,
Moderator,1414,20,"You need to give an answer yes, but you can change it after the second conversation. ",85,
Pence,1481,67,"For now, I will say I.A. Even if it did a typo in the end, it seemed to have trouble picking up some information I gave it. ",124,
Moderator,1519,38,"Alright. We&#039;ll begin the second conversation. Andrew will start again and then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? ",146,
Pence,1529,10,"Yes. ",5,
Andrew,1533,4,"Hello! ",7,
Pence,1544,11,"Hello ! How are you ? ",22,2
Andrew,1553,9,"I&#039;m doing alright! How about you? ",39,2
Pence,1624,71,"Perfectly fine ! Sun is piercing through the rainy sky right now. Lovely evening in France.  ",93,2
Andrew,1673,49,"Oh you&#039;re French! Nice. I live in Canada. It&#039;s nice and sunny here right now. ",88,2
Pence,1808,135,"Warm summers and cold winters, right ? Where are you from, if I may ask ? ",74,2
Andrew,1846,38,"I study in London, in the Ontario. Not sure if you know where that is. ",71,2
Pence,1944,98,"Isn&#039;t it a town, like near the border of the united States ?  ",67,2
Andrew,2005,61,"Well, not quite near the border, but essentially yes. I&#039;ve always lived here. ",83,2
Pence,2067,62,"Near the great lakes, I guess ? Must be a pretty awesome place to live, if you like nature and all of that. ",108,2
Andrew,2187,120,"Niagara falls are about 3 hours away. And yeah it&#039;s great when you have a car. ",84,2
Andrew,2224,37,"Niagara falls are about 3 hours away. And yeah it&#039;s great when you have a car. ",84,2
Pence,2356,132,"Back, sorry. Niagara falls ? That&#039;s good to know. It may sound silly to you, but I never quite knew where to place these on a map. The more you know ! ",156,2
Andrew,2403,47,"Yeah, they are quite impressive to see. There are lots of tourists though as you can probably imagine. ",103,2
Pence,2488,85,"Among the biggest waterfalls in the world, I too would love to get a look at them. Even if I prefer tropical climates.  ",120,2
Moderator,2523,35,"Time is up! ",12,
Pence,2540,17,"Okay ! ",7,
Moderator,2563,23,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Pence,2610,47,"I&#039;ll remain on my first opinion.  I think it was an A.I ",61,
Moderator,2617,7,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? ",90,
Pence,2636,19,"3 ",2,
Moderator,2640,4,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2649,9,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, you can do so now. Otherwise you can close this window. ",107,
Pence,2690,41,"I guess I&#039;ll have to wait for the results to know who was the A.I ? ",73,
Moderator,2711,21,"No, I can tell you after your comments, or right now if you don&#039;t have any. ",81,
Pence,2795,84,"It was a pretty hard, so I&#039;m very , very curious to know about it. I don&#039;t have any comments. ",104,
Moderator,2812,17,"You were right! ",16,
Pence,2841,29,"So it is capable of making fake typos ? A smart feature.  ",58,
Moderator,2879,38,"Indeed it is! Thanks a lot for your help. ",42,
Pence,2905,26,"You&#039;re welcome, it was a very interesting experience. Good day to you ! ",77,
