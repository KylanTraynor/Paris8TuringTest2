<span id="time-span">04:14:20</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:14:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Welcome Wade. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:33</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Hi there! 
<span id="time-span">04:14:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">04:14:51</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>No problem! What&#039;s your major? 
<span id="time-span">04:15:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Psychology &amp; Human Cognition 
<span id="time-span">04:15:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">04:16:00</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Oooh a game! How exciting! I&#039;m ready! 
<span id="time-span">04:16:03</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">04:16:11</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Okay! 
<span id="time-span">04:16:13</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">04:16:21</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">04:16:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">04:16:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">04:16:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">04:16:54</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Can he be named HAL? 
<span id="time-span">04:17:07</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Sorry! Sorry, I&#039;ll be good. 
<span id="time-span">04:17:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">04:17:28</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">04:17:36</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">04:17:47</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">04:17:57</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">04:18:05</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">04:18:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">04:18:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">04:18:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">04:18:38</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Yes I do. 
<span id="time-span">04:18:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">04:19:16</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I am ready! 
<span id="time-span">04:19:19</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:19:27</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Hi there Andrew! 
<span id="time-span">04:19:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">04:19:53</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>So far so good. It&#039;s my day off, so I&#039;ve been relaxing. How has your day been? Been up to much? 
<span id="time-span">04:20:36</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;ve been alright too. Mostly playing games actually. 
<span id="time-span">04:20:58</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>What kind of games do you like to play? 
<span id="time-span">04:21:23</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Minecraft is the one I play the most. I&#039;ve also been enjoying Mass Effect for the last week. 
<span id="time-span">04:21:58</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I&#039;ve never played Mass Effect before. What game mechanics do you like the most? 
<span id="time-span">04:22:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you mean? Specifically in Mass Effect or in general? 
<span id="time-span">04:22:47</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Specifically in Mass Effect. What do you like about the gameplay? 
<span id="time-span">04:23:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I like how the plot depends on your choices and actions. It&#039;s not really gameplay, but the characters are also fantastic. 
<span id="time-span">04:24:20</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Do you prefer FPS or TPS? 
<span id="time-span">04:25:15</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not a huge fan of shooter games in general, but I guess Mass Effect could be labeled as a TPS, so I&#039;ll say that. 
<span id="time-span">04:25:40</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>What else do you do for fun? Any hobbies? 
<span id="time-span">04:26:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I like reading, but I haven&#039;t been able to do that enough for a while actually. 
<span id="time-span">04:26:51</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>What have you been up to besides reading? 
<span id="time-span">04:27:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>College work mostly. I study Biology. 
<span id="time-span">04:28:03</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>What kind of biology is your passion? Human biology, marine biology, avian biology, something else? 
<span id="time-span">04:28:46</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Neurology actually. That kinda goes across all of what you said. But more specifically human neurology. 
<span id="time-span">04:29:11</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I find the brain so complex. Do you think we&#039;ll ever fully understand the human mind? 
<span id="time-span">04:29:47</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>If we do, I doubt that it will be anytime soon. 
<span id="time-span">04:30:44</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>How long have you been in school? 
<span id="time-span">04:31:40</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, I&#039;m in my 3rd year of university. So... yeah. 
<span id="time-span">04:32:02</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>What are your plans for the future? What would you like to do with your major? 
<span id="time-span">04:32:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;d like to do research. I want to figure out how neurons interact with each other and how we learn. 
<span id="time-span">04:33:31</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I like to figure that out too. I&#039;m an Instructor, so I like to see how better I can teach my students. 
<span id="time-span">04:34:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>There&#039;s quite a few studies that have been made about that actually. 
<span id="time-span">04:34:29</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I know that. My mother was a school  psychologist, so I normally ask her for new information.
<span id="time-span">04:34:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">04:34:51</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Is it bad that I was taking notes? 
<span id="time-span">04:35:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">04:35:16</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>(It&#039;s fine) 
<span id="time-span">04:35:58</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>It is hard to tell. I tried to slip the actor up, but I know good AI&#039;s are not put off by that. I&#039;m leaning toward AI, actually. 
<span id="time-span">04:36:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. We&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes after your answer. Are you ready? 
<span id="time-span">04:37:01</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I am ready. 
<span id="time-span">04:37:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">04:37:32</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Hi there! 
<span id="time-span">04:37:38</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you doing? 
<span id="time-span">04:37:53</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I&#039;m alright. How are you? What all have you been up to today? 
<span id="time-span">04:38:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. I haven&#039;t been up to much really. Mostly just playing games. You? 
<span id="time-span">04:39:09</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I&#039;m mostly watching Judge Judy. Is it odd that it helps me concentrate? 
<span id="time-span">04:39:41</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I can&#039;t tell, I&#039;ve never seen that actually. 
<span id="time-span">04:40:21</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>It&#039;s pretty fun. What sort of hobbies do you have? Any favorite types of games? 
<span id="time-span">04:41:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Yeah, I tend to spend my time playing Minecraft. and I&#039;ve been very much into Mass Effect for the last week or so. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">04:41:53</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I play a ton of Warframe. Ever played that? It&#039;s super fun. 
<span id="time-span">04:42:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve even ever heard about it no. What is it? 
<span id="time-span">04:43:25</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>It&#039;s a beautiful combination of hack-n-slash and TPS. I like TPS over FPS. What do you prefer? 
<span id="time-span">04:44:20</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m not really sure. I haven&#039;t liked many FPS games, so I guess I like TPS more. 
<span id="time-span">04:45:01</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>What is it about TPS that makes you like it more? 
<span id="time-span">04:46:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I can&#039;t say I like it more specifically. But I do tend to like games that are in TPS. So I don&#039;t really know. 
<span id="time-span">04:47:02</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>How do you feel about AI? Will it ever sound like a human? 
<span id="time-span">04:48:17</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I don&#039;t know about sound, but I&#039;d say that we&#039;re getting closer about text at least. A good question might be : does it need to feel like a human? 
<span id="time-span">04:48:45</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>If the objective is to mimic humans, then I say yes. 
<span id="time-span">04:49:18</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well yeah. If it&#039;s about being useful it&#039;s another topic entirely. 
<span id="time-span">04:50:01</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I agree. Do you think robots will replace humans in the workforce? Is that a good thing? 
<span id="time-span">04:50:55</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I do, to some extent. Whether it&#039;s a good thing or not depends on if we&#039;re able to anticipate it enough by rethinking our societies. 
<span id="time-span">04:51:55</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>The human brain and societies is interesting to me, being an instructor. 
<span id="time-span">04:52:43</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">04:53:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">04:53:00</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>I think I got this. 
<span id="time-span">04:53:10</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>The first interaction was the AI. 
<span id="time-span">04:53:22</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how confident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">04:53:43</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>6 
<span id="time-span">04:53:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">04:53:58</span><span id="name-span">Wade</span>Thanks! 
<span id="time-span">04:54:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now. Otherwise you can now close this window.
