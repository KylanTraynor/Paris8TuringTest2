<span id="time-span">16:18:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Hello me. 
<span id="time-span">16:22:06</span><span id="name-span">me</span>...hello? 
<span id="time-span">16:22:20</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Thank you for participating in this study. 
<span id="time-span">16:22:48</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. 
<span id="time-span">16:23:00</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. 
<span id="time-span">16:23:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. 
<span id="time-span">16:23:27</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. 
<span id="time-span">16:23:38</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. 
<span id="time-span">16:24:01</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. 
<span id="time-span">16:24:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. 
<span id="time-span">16:24:23</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. 
<span id="time-span">16:24:34</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. 
<span id="time-span">16:24:45</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. 
<span id="time-span">16:24:56</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. 
<span id="time-span">16:25:10</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation. 
<span id="time-span">16:25:25</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. 
<span id="time-span">16:25:33</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) 
<span id="time-span">16:25:42</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do not type more than one post per answer. 
<span id="time-span">16:25:51</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? 
<span id="time-span">16:25:57</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I do understand. 
<span id="time-span">16:26:12</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. 
<span id="time-span">16:26:30</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">16:26:41</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Hi there. 
<span id="time-span">16:26:49</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>How are you? 
<span id="time-span">16:27:09</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I&#039;m alright.  Are you? 
<span id="time-span">16:27:22</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I am yes. What are you up to? 
<span id="time-span">16:27:57</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Other than talking to you?  Looking out of the window longingly at Spring, wishing I could be outside.  Is it warm where you are, too? 
<span id="time-span">16:28:42</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not really no. But it&#039;s decent. 
<span id="time-span">16:29:19</span><span id="name-span">me</span>So it&#039;s not sunny, but it&#039;s not raining either? 
<span id="time-span">16:29:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s just mostly cloudy, yeah. 51&deg;F. 
<span id="time-span">16:30:52</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Have other people that have spoken to you today also asked about the weather? 
<span id="time-span">16:31:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Not really no. Haven&#039;t been talking to many people yet. 
<span id="time-span">16:32:13</span><span id="name-span">me</span>How far through our time do you think we are? 
<span id="time-span">16:32:53</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Something like 5 minutes? I don&#039;t really know. 
<span id="time-span">16:33:29</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I&#039;ve never been good at judging time. 
<span id="time-span">16:34:24</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Question of rhythm I guess. Where do you live? 
<span id="time-span">16:35:07</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I live right on the edge of London.  At least, according to most people, living right by the circular motorway that goes around London is the edge of &#039;real London&#039;. 
<span id="time-span">16:36:07</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Are you from the UK London? I live in London too, though not in the same country I imagine. 
<span id="time-span">16:36:18</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Yes, the UK London. 
<span id="time-span">16:36:29</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Canadian one here. 
<span id="time-span">16:36:57</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I&#039;m sure there are plenty of internet articles arguing over which London is better. 
<span id="time-span">16:37:26</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>There is little to do in mine.  I&#039;m pretty sure it&#039;s your London.
<span id="time-span">16:37:49</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I guess that&#039;s true.  Only one of them is a capital. 
<span id="time-span">16:38:32</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Right. What do you do for work? Or are you a student? 
<span id="time-span">16:38:52</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I work in Cybersecurity.  I protect organisations from malicious threat actors. 
<span id="time-span">16:39:14</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Oh I see. Do you think I&#039;m one of those? 
<span id="time-span">16:39:28</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Depends, are you trying to exfiltrate money from banks? 
<span id="time-span">16:40:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>In my past life, I&#039;ve tried. It didn&#039;t succeed. T hat&#039;s why it was my past life.
<span id="time-span">16:40:30</span><span id="name-span">me</span>If you had succeeded, you&#039;d have spent some time in jail and then you&#039;d have probably still considered it a past life. 
<span id="time-span">16:40:51</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That&#039;s true enough I guess yeah. 
<span id="time-span">16:41:30</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Can you remind me of what your weather was like? 
<span id="time-span">16:41:45</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Mostly cloudy. 
<span id="time-span">16:41:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">16:42:08</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to (This is not your final answer) 
<span id="time-span">16:42:14</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Human. 
<span id="time-span">16:42:53</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. The next conversation is about to begin. Andrew will start, and you&#039;ll have 15 minutes maximum after you answer. 
<span id="time-span">16:43:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Hello! 
<span id="time-span">16:43:20</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Hi there.  How are you doing today? 
<span id="time-span">16:43:31</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m doing alright. What about you? 
<span id="time-span">16:43:49</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I&#039;ve had better days. 
<span id="time-span">16:44:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Something wrong? 
<span id="time-span">16:44:20</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I just wish I was able to be outside is all. 
<span id="time-span">16:44:35</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Maybe you should do that then. 
<span id="time-span">16:44:47</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Oh, but then I&#039;d miss out on talking to you. 
<span id="time-span">16:45:02</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>And that would be such a shame! 
<span id="time-span">16:45:16</span><span id="name-span">me</span>So now do you see why I can&#039;t be outside? 
<span id="time-span">16:45:43</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I&#039;m the only thing keeping you in? Don&#039;t worry it shouldn&#039;t stay like that for too long then. 
<span id="time-span">16:46:17</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Answering your questions is what is keeping me in. 
<span id="time-span">16:46:56</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Is it that nice outside? Can&#039;t say it is great where I am. 
<span id="time-span">16:47:25</span><span id="name-span">me</span>It&#039;s nice enough for me to want to be. 
<span id="time-span">16:48:25</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>I see. What do you do outside? Just enjoy the sun? 
<span id="time-span">16:48:54</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I have some things to buy. 
<span id="time-span">16:49:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>That doesn&#039;t sound as relaxing as I expected. 
<span id="time-span">16:49:36</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Some people might prefer it. 
<span id="time-span">16:50:39</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Whenever there&#039;s some decent weather, I just find a patch of grass and relax. Or sit on the balcony. 
<span id="time-span">16:51:24</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I don&#039;t have a balcony.  I&#039;d like to find a place to buy that has one, though.  There&#039;s a lot of stresses in life that could absolutely be solved by sitting out and just staring at the horizon for a b
<span id="time-span">16:51:29</span><span id="name-span">me</span>it 
<span id="time-span">16:52:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>With a cup of tea in your hand. 
<span id="time-span">16:52:46</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Sounds nice. 
<span id="time-span">16:53:13</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>It&#039;s been months since the last time I did it. 
<span id="time-span">16:53:30</span><span id="name-span">me</span>When did you last do it? 
<span id="time-span">16:54:00</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>The beginning of September, when it was still warm outside. 
<span id="time-span">16:54:03</span><span id="name-span">me</span>How much of it did you do?  Just the tea? 
<span id="time-span">16:54:16</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sorry what? 
<span id="time-span">16:54:54</span><span id="name-span">me</span>How much of that idyllic scene we spoke about did you manage to do? 
<span id="time-span">16:55:58</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Well, last time I did it, it was on my balcony with some peppermint tea. Can&#039;t say the horizon was great to look at, but... Is that what you asked? 
<span id="time-span">16:56:16</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Yeah.  Sounds beautiful.  How long through the time do you think we are? 
<span id="time-span">16:56:37</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Been a while. I&#039;d say we should be almost done. 
<span id="time-span">16:56:50</span><span id="name-span">me</span>And then I might get to go outside. 
<span id="time-span">16:57:06</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>What do you want to buy by the way? 
<span id="time-span">16:57:36</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Maybe some peppermint tea. 
<span id="time-span">16:57:54</span><span id="name-span">Andrew</span>Sounds like idea theft. 
<span id="time-span">16:58:26</span><span id="name-span">me</span>Tastes like peppermint tea. 
<span id="time-span">16:58:26</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Time is up! 
<span id="time-span">16:58:41</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  
<span id="time-span">16:58:56</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I&#039;ve changed my mind.  I think the first one was the AI now. 
<span id="time-span">16:59:11</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain), how comfident are you of your answer? 
<span id="time-span">16:59:17</span><span id="name-span">me</span>5. 
<span id="time-span">16:59:32</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given your e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  
<span id="time-span">17:00:14</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>You can give some comments, or close this window if you&#039;re done. 
<span id="time-span">17:00:50</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I started off thinking that the first one was human because it felt like a human pretending to be AI.  It felt like you had set them rules for how to talk (predominantly two sentences maximum). 
<span id="time-span">17:01:02</span><span id="name-span">me</span>However, thinking back on it, I wasn&#039;t overly complex with how I questioned the first. 
<span id="time-span">17:01:23</span><span id="name-span">me</span>When I spoke to the second, I was trying very hard to force the actor to use context to talk to me.  Use things from previous sentences and previous lines. 
<span id="time-span">17:01:57</span><span id="name-span">me</span>I noticed there was more complexity and variety in their speech, and even when I said slightly more vague or unintelligible things, I got back a more human response (sorry what? )
<span id="time-span">17:02:54</span><span id="name-span">Moderator</span>Alright. Thank you again for participating. You can now close this window. 
<span id="time-span">17:02:55</span><span id="name-span">me</span>As such, I believe the first was dealing with sentences in a formulaic manner, and the second was being more adventurous with their responses.
