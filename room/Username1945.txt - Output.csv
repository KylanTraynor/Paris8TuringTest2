Username1945,1,1,"Good day,  fellow human.",24,
Moderator,2,1,"Thank you for participating in this study. ",43,
Moderator,13,11,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
Username1945,34,21,"I am very well capable of reading this. Yes. ",45,
Moderator,41,7,"Good. In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",110,
Moderator,49,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Username1945,53,4,"I see. ",7,
Moderator,60,7,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,67,7,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,74,7,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,81,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,88,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,97,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,104,7,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,111,7,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,118,7,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,127,9,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Username1945,134,7,"In brackets? ",13,
Moderator,135,1,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,143,8,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,151,8,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,159,8,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
Username1945,170,11,"Except for the [STOP] Part, yes. ",33,
Username1945,194,24,"Do I say it in brackets or without? ",36,
Moderator,217,23,"Whenever you&#039;ve made your decision on which actor you&#039;re talking to, you&#039;re able to stop the conversation if you do not want to keep talking to them. You can say it with or without brackets it doesn&#039;t",220,
Moderator,224,7,"matter, as long as it&#039;s explicit. ",39,
Username1945,227,3,"Aight then. ",12,
Username1945,240,13,"I&#039;m good to go. ",21,
Moderator,247,7,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
Username1945,265,18,"I was born ready. ",18,
Andrew,270,5,"Hello! ",7,
Username1945,274,4,"Hey there ",10,1
Andrew,284,10,"How are you? ",13,1
Username1945,297,13,"Pondering on existentialism. And you? ",38,1
Andrew,314,17,"Doing quite alright. ",21,1
Username1945,347,33,"Good enough I guess? So, &quot;andrew&quot;. What have you been up to this week? ",81,1
Andrew,367,20,"Not much. Mostly playing games. ",32,1
Username1945,385,18,"Ah, alrgiht. What kinda games? Any favorites? ",46,1
Andrew,413,28,"Yeah Minecraft mostly. I played the last Mass Effect too. ",58,1
Username1945,445,32,"What do you like abou minecraft? ",33,1
Andrew,473,28,"Building. ",10,1
Username1945,487,14,"What kind of things do you build? ",34,1
Andrew,503,16,"Medieval things in general. ",28,1
Username1945,514,11,"Which blocks do you mostly use for that? ",41,1
Andrew,541,27,"It depends, but mostly Cobblestone and Logs. ",45,1
Username1945,572,31,"Mh, I see. How much time do youn invest every day in Minecraft then? ",69,1
Andrew,605,33,"Lately a good amount of hours. ",31,1
Username1945,628,23,"So how old are you anyway? ",27,1
Andrew,643,15,"I&#039;m 21. You? ",18,1
Username1945,683,40,"24, but that&#039;s not really important. What philosopher do you like? ",72,1
Andrew,713,30,"I don&#039;t really know honestly. ",35,1
Username1945,729,16,"No? Then how do you decide what the point in life is? ",54,1
Andrew,741,12,"I just make my own. ",20,1
Username1945,748,7,"What is it then? ",17,1
Andrew,765,17,"Learning more about life. I study Biology. ",43,1
Username1945,808,43,"Oh, cool. I study too. But I don&#039;t think that topic will get us any closer to resolving wether or not you are the person-actor or the artificial-actor. ",157,1
Andrew,833,25,"Ah ok. What do you want to talk about then? ",44,1
Username1945,844,11,"I dunno. Are we even real? ",27,1
Andrew,865,21,"Depends. ",9,1
Username1945,876,11,"Upon what does it depend? ",26,1
Andrew,902,26,"On what your definition of real is. ",36,1
Username1945,913,11,"Could you define real then? ",28,1
Andrew,964,51,"I guess we&#039;re real if we are able to interact with other things that also exist. ",86,1
Username1945,988,24,"But how do you judge if something actually exists or if we just perceive it to be? ",83,1
Andrew,1013,25,"I don&#039;t, I let that to philosophers. ",42,1
Username1945,1033,20,"You said you don&#039;t care about philosophers though... ? ",60,1
Andrew,1053,20,"I said I don&#039;t have a favorite one. ",41,1
Username1945,1133,80,"Hm, other topic then? ",22,1
Andrew,1164,31,"Do you like Game of Thrones? ",29,1
Username1945,1177,13,"Nah, do you? If so, why? ",25,1
Moderator,1178,1,"Time is up! ",12,
Username1945,1182,4,"Nooooooooooo ",13,
Username1945,1197,15,"Bye &quot;andrew&quot; ",23,
Moderator,1198,1,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
Username1945,1203,5,"The bot. ",9,
Moderator,1208,5,"Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? ",141,
Username1945,1221,13,"I was born ready. ",18,
Andrew,1225,4,"Hello! ",7,
Username1945,1229,4,"Heya there ",11,2
Andrew,1234,5,"How are you doing? ",19,2
Username1945,1245,11,"I&#039;m okay, just had a weird conversation, but that&#039;s all. ",67,2
Andrew,1258,13,"Oh? What happened? ",19,2
Username1945,1281,23,"Idunno. The guy was just acting strange. Anyhow. You doing alright? ",68,2
Andrew,1312,31,"I am yeah! Just playing a game right now. Paused it though obviously. ",70,2
Username1945,1334,22,"Yeah, it helps to pause them in order to  not-die.",50,2
Andrew,1370,36,"Actually it&#039;s on a server, so pausing it is not enough, but yes, basically. ",81,2
Username1945,1389,19,"What are you playing then? ",27,2
Andrew,1407,18,"Minecraft. I play way too much of that. ",40,2
Username1945,1415,8,"Jeez, like how uch? ",20,2
Andrew,1432,17,"Hours a day. I have plenty of time right now as I&#039;m in summer break. ",74,2
Username1945,1448,16,"Oh, that&#039;s cool. What kinda stuff do you do in Minecraft then? ",68,2
Andrew,1467,19,"I mostly build. Castles, fortresses and things like that. ",58,2
Username1945,1493,26,"I guess the game kind of caters to that most, makes sense. ",59,2
Andrew,1513,20,"Some people make modern buildings with it, I think those just look ugly though. ",80,2
Username1945,1545,32,"Yeah, they do. I think you can get pretty close to the Runescape architecture with the minecraft blocks. Would you agree on that? ",130,2
Andrew,1570,25,"I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve actually played Runescape, so I couldn&#039;t tell. ",81,2
Username1945,1618,48,"Why not? Basically everyone and their mum tried it at some point. ",66,2
Andrew,1651,33,"Never seen the point. You think I should give it a try? ",56,2
Username1945,1676,25,"I think it&#039;s pretty outdated, but if you want to give a low-end machine MMORPG a try it might be the best. ",112,2
Andrew,1726,50,"Fair enough. I haven&#039;t played a MMORPG in a very long time, so that might be worth a shot. ",96,2
Username1945,1746,20,"Sure. btw, how much dedodated wam do you run a minecraft server on? ",68,2
Andrew,1791,45,"Ouch typos. So far we have 8GB. Why? ",37,2
Username1945,1828,37,"Just wondering what you put into the baby. You watching minecon when its on? ",77,2
Andrew,1859,31,"Nope not really. ",17,2
Username1945,1918,59,"You should, hilarious things occur there.   Do you apply any rules of architecture or general art to your builds in MC? ",120,2
Andrew,1958,40,"Yeah, I try to stick to as much realism as possible, or at least, things that look believable. ",95,2
Username1945,2000,42,"Cool, but do you apply rules in doing that? Like, consciously? ",63,2
Andrew,2067,67,"To some extent. Mostly for weight distribution. I&#039;m not actually using hard rules, but documentation and intuition. ",121,2
Username1945,2098,31,"But you do know about basics like the golden cut and the Fibonacci sequence, right? ",84,2
Andrew,2139,41,"I do. But I don&#039;t actually calculate it each time. I go for things that have roughly decent proportions. ",110,2
Moderator,2150,11,"Time is up! ",12,
Username1945,2155,5,"Noooooooooooooooooooooooo ",26,
Moderator,2169,14,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to in the first conversation?  ",81,
Username1945,2179,10,"Still think it was the bot. ",28,
Username1945,2183,4,"More now than I did before. ",28,
Moderator,2191,8,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? ",89,
Username1945,2196,5,"6 ",2,
Moderator,2204,8,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2209,5,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  ",118,
Username1945,2227,18,"When will I 7 know who was the bot? ",36,
Moderator,2243,16,"I can tell you after your comments, or right now if you have none. ",67,
Username1945,2264,21,"I think the first one had less social intelligence. ",52,
Moderator,2281,17,"What makes you think that? ",27,
Username1945,2291,10,"&quot;My guts&quot; as a linguist. ",35,
Moderator,2303,12,"Alright. If he was the human he&#039;ll be happy. ",50,
Moderator,2322,19,"I can give you the answer now if you&#039;d like. ",50,
Username1945,2322,0,"He certainly will, but that&#039;D just mean the AI learnt A LOT. ",66,
Username1945,2328,6,"Sure ",5,
Moderator,2337,9,"The first conversation was with the AI. ",40,
Username1945,2342,5,"Toldya ",7,
Moderator,2354,12,"Thank you very much for your help! ",35,
Username1945,2360,6,"Glad I could help. ",19,
Username1945,2375,15,"The secodn one also had an error  here and there btw ",53,
Moderator,2393,18,"Humans are not perfect either. ",31,
Username1945,2399,6,"The AI might need to adapt a corruption percentage or something. ",65,
Username1945,2401,2,"Exactly. ",9,
Moderator,2420,19,"What do you mean by a corruption percentage? ",45,
Username1945,2427,7,"There was no typo in the first, so it was much more likely to be a bot. ",72,
Moderator,2443,16,"Right. ",7,
Username1945,2455,12,"If you&#039;d get statistics of how often certain letters get mixed up while typing or where puncuation errors might land, it&#039;d be more convinging. ",153,
Username1945,2458,3,"*convincing ",12,
Username1945,2479,21,"So, how many people got it right? ",34,
Username1945,2486,7,"Of the odd-seventy you had so far. ",35,
Moderator,2538,52,"So far, in total, 43 found the AI and 30 were wrong. ",53,
Username1945,2584,46,"mh, I expected that to be higher. But then, I wouldn&#039;t know what groups participate. ",90,
Username1945,2604,20,"It was interesting. I hope you can get your 90 peeps. ",54,
Moderator,2624,20,"We are using 3 different AI, the one you had to deal with had 13 getting it right, and 12 getting it wrong. ",108,
Username1945,2646,22,"I broke the draw then. :^) ",27,
Moderator,2664,18,"Indeed! ",8,
Username1945,2673,9,"Are the other two better or worse, detection wise? ",51,
Username1945,2711,38,"Also, sorry if I was a bit harsh, but I had to apply some pressure to find things out. ^^&quot; ",96,
Moderator,2726,15,"The other one is 16 right against 8 wrong, and the last one is 14 right against 10 ",83,
Moderator,2732,6,"No worries, that&#039;s part of the test. ",42,
Username1945,2755,23,"So I actually faced the most convinci ng one.",45,
Moderator,2768,13,"It would seem like so yes. ",27,
Username1945,2795,27,"Hmm. ",5,
Username1945,2802,7,"So is mod also [andrew]? ",25,
Moderator,2814,12,"The human one yes. ",19,
Username1945,2823,9,"Yes, the other one was &quot;andrew&quot;. ",43,
Username1945,2844,21,"Alright. You have any questions? ",33,
Moderator,2859,15,"No we have enough information. Thank you again! ",48,
Username1945,2888,29,"Thanks for helping. Keep science going. Also keep Asimov in mind while working on AI, thnx. ",92,
Moderator,2899,11,"Yes of course! ",15,
Username1945,2906,7,"Have a good one! ",17,
Moderator,2913,7,"You too! ",9,
