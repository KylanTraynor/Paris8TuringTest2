Moderator,0,0,"Hello ErikaTheZebra! ",21,
Moderator,10,10,"Thank you for participating in this study! ",43,
Moderator,30,20,"In the next posts, I&#039;ll be going over the rules of the &quot;game&quot; you&#039;re about to play. ",104,
Moderator,35,5,"Are you able to read this? ",27,
ErikaTheZebra,231,196,"I can now~  Sorry about that ",29,
Moderator,252,21,"No problem. ",12,
Moderator,260,8,"Once I&#039;ll be done, I&#039;ll ask you if you&#039;ve understood the rules, and if you haven&#039;t I&#039;ll explain them in different words. ",146,
Moderator,276,16,"You&#039;re about to talk to Andrew. Andrew is a fictive character that has been completely created for the purpose of this study. ",131,
Moderator,286,10,"You&#039;ll be talking to him twice. ",37,
Moderator,293,7,"The only difference between the two conversations you&#039;ll have with him, is that in one of them Andrew will be played by a real human. ",139,
Moderator,300,7,"In the other, it will be played by an Artificial Intelligence we are developing. ",81,
Moderator,307,7,"We will call the Human and the Artificial Intelligence the Actors. ",67,
Moderator,316,9,"The order in which you&#039;ll be talking to each Actor is random. ",67,
Moderator,324,8,"You will not be talking twice with the same Actor. ",51,
Moderator,346,22,"Both the Artificial Intelligence and the Human will try to portray the same Andrew in the most convincing way they can. ",120,
Moderator,356,10,"Your goal is simple. After talking to the two actors, you&#039;ll have to guess which one was the Artificial Intelligence and which one was the Human. ",151,
Moderator,364,8,"Whenever you have made your decision, you are able to stop the conversation by saying [STOP] ",93,
Moderator,373,9,"Each conversation will last for 15 minutes maximum if you do not decide to stop it before. ",91,
Moderator,380,7,"Please, keep your posts to text only (No smileys, no links... etc) ",67,
Moderator,389,9,"Do not type more than one post per answer. ",43,
Moderator,400,11,"Do you understand the rules and what you have to do? ",53,
ErikaTheZebra,409,9,"Yes ",4,
Moderator,415,6,"Good. Andrew will start the conversation. The 15 minutes will start after your answer. Are you ready? ",102,
ErikaTheZebra,424,9,"I am ready ",11,
Andrew,433,9,"Hello! ",7,
ErikaTheZebra,452,19,"Hello~ ",7,1
Andrew,460,8,"How are you doing? ",19,1
ErikaTheZebra,483,23,"I&#039;m alright, how&#039;re you? ",35,1
Andrew,501,18,"I&#039;m doing quite alright too! What are you up to? ",54,1
ErikaTheZebra,528,27,"Currently wasting time by watching youtube videos. ",51,1
Andrew,554,26,"Oh yeah I know the feeling. I do that quite a lot as well. What kind of things do you watch? ",93,1
ErikaTheZebra,601,47,"Right now, I&#039;m watching Joel from Vinesauce play that awful Klingon FMV game from a while back. ",101,1
Andrew,631,30,"I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve heard of that game. I do like Vinesauce a lot too though! ",87,1
ErikaTheZebra,658,27,"Which of the Vinesauce streamers is your favorite? ",51,1
Andrew,726,68,"I&#039;m not really sure actually. It really depends on the video. ",67,1
ErikaTheZebra,792,66,"Fair enough.  I think Vinny is my favorite out of the lot. ",59,1
Andrew,813,21,"I definitely like his voice, and the corruption videos are quite awesome. ",74,1
ErikaTheZebra,894,81,"I mostly like his garbage sunday streams.  Some of the stuff that people send him is truly terrible ",100,1
Andrew,988,94,"That&#039;s very true yeah. Are there other youtubers you like to watch? I follow a lot of minecraft related ones myself. Game of Thrones theories are awesome too. ",164,1
ErikaTheZebra,1037,49,"Honestly, aside from the core Vinesauce Streamsers and Idubbbbz, I don&#039;t closely follow any other youttubers. ",115,1
Andrew,1095,58,"Ah I see. Do you play any video games, or do you prefer just watching others play? ",83,1
ErikaTheZebra,1172,77,"I used to play a lot more games back in the day, but I don&#039;t much anymore.  I was playing Skyrim before hopping on here though. ",133,1
Andrew,1208,36,"I liked Skyrim a lot. I&#039;ve spent a lot less time on it than I did on Oblivion though. ",91,1
ErikaTheZebra,1279,71,"I actually didn&#039;t play through Oblivion properly until I finished Skyrim.  I appreciate how much more is in Oblivion than in Skyrim. ",138,1
Andrew,1340,61,"The world mostly seemed a bit more vibrant and interesting to me. But I might be biased because it was my first Elders&#039; Scrolls. ",134,1
Moderator,1364,24,"Time is up! ",12,
Moderator,1382,18,"Which actor do you think you&#039;ve been talking to? ",54,
ErikaTheZebra,1435,53,"Well, at first I wanted to say it was a human before of a grammatical error, but then it was constant, so I want to say it was the AI. ",135,
Moderator,1465,30,"Alright, we&#039;ll begin the next conversation. Andrew will start, then you&#039;ll have 15 minutes again after your answer. Are you ready? ",141,
ErikaTheZebra,1477,12,"yes ",4,
Andrew,1487,10,"Hello! ",7,
ErikaTheZebra,1496,9,"Hello~ ",7,2
Andrew,1502,6,"How are you doing? ",19,2
ErikaTheZebra,1511,9,"I ",2,2
Andrew,1516,5,"You? ",5,2
ErikaTheZebra,1537,21,"Whoops.  I&#039;m doing alright, how&#039;re you? ",50,2
Andrew,1552,15,"I&#039;m doing quite alright too! What are you up to? ",54,2
ErikaTheZebra,1577,25,"I&#039;m currently wasting time on youtube with various youtube videos ",71,2
Andrew,1609,32,"Oh yeah, I do that a lot too actually. What are you watching? ",62,2
ErikaTheZebra,1644,35,"At this current moment, just watching complete trash.  I&#039;ll be going back to watching Joel in a moment though. ",116,2
Andrew,1662,18,"Joel? ",6,2
ErikaTheZebra,1689,27,"One of the Vinesauce streamers.  Usually the second most popular of the lot ",76,2
Andrew,1714,25,"Oh I see! I quite like Vinesauce actually. ",43,2
ErikaTheZebra,1745,31,"Which of the Vinesauce  streamers is your favorite?",51,2
Andrew,1774,29,"I don&#039;t know if I really have one actually. You? ",54,2
ErikaTheZebra,1819,45,"That&#039;s a hard decision, but I think I&#039;d have to choose Vinny  ",72,2
Andrew,1835,16,"Why Vinny? ",11,2
ErikaTheZebra,1886,51,"Well, he pumps out the most content and he&#039;s generally a really funny guy, despite how much  he craps on himself.",118,2
Andrew,1944,58,"Oh yeah I see. ",15,2
ErikaTheZebra,2106,162,"[stop ]",7,2
ErikaTheZebra,2118,12,"I believe  I have a guess",25,
Moderator,2121,3,"Conversation Interrupted! ",26,
ErikaTheZebra,2138,17,"The one I just talked to was the AI ",36,
Moderator,2147,9,"On a scale from 1 (not sure at all) to 7 (certain) how confident are you of your answer? ",89,
ErikaTheZebra,2159,12,"5 ",2,
Moderator,2179,20,"Alright thank you for your participation! If you&#039;ve given you e-mail, we&#039;ll send you some information about the results of this study in the coming months.  ",167,
Moderator,2185,6,"If you have any comments you&#039;d like to share, feel free to do so now, otherwise, you can now close this window.  ",118,
ErikaTheZebra,2208,23,"Oh, alrighty~  Did I guess right? ",34,
Moderator,2230,22,"I can tell you after your comments, or if you don&#039;t have any I can tell you right now. ",92,
ErikaTheZebra,2311,81,"I think the only comment I can make is that I mostly based my decision on the second Andrew&#039;s supposed lack of knowledge of Vinesauce.  There&#039;s no real reason to give an AI knowledge of a Let&#039;s Player",215,
ErikaTheZebra,2327,16,"That&#039;s all I have to add ",30,
Moderator,2351,24,"Alright. The AI was indeed the second one! ",43,
ErikaTheZebra,2375,24,"Heh, who knew watching some obscure Let&#039;s Player would help me out. ",73,
ErikaTheZebra,2378,3,"That was fun ",13,
Moderator,2387,9,"Glad that you enjoyed it! ",26,
